2. Press the**Home** button on the remote control to launch the Smart Hub.
3. A series of icons for inputs, content, and more appear. At the bottom, you'll see a variety of settings in a separate bar. Using the remote control, navigate to the bottom bar, scroll, and select**Source** .
4. Above the bottom bar, you'll see a series of icons showing the TV inputs. Select**Remote Access** .
5. Choose**Remote PC** .
6. You'll see a large window labeled**Connect to Remote PC** . You're asked to enter your PC's credentials. To create a new PC profile, select the**User** **icon** located to the right of the PC/Profile box to launch the**User Profiles** window.
