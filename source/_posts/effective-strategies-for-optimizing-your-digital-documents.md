Hi,

 I purchased Epubor Vitalsource downloader. I was trying to convert a textbook into a pdf file, but it failed. There was a output file, in which there is a phrase "Please refresh your browser" with a picture of a robot on all pages. I tried many times, but all failed. Please let me know how to solve this problem.

 Thanks

I download DRM removal for free trial and want to decrypt some EPUB files, when I drag them to the software, most of them are decrypted, but only the rest one failed and I get the error message "your book is protected by a kind of DRM we do not support".

[Convert MyMustReads content](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/20/2020 3:42:55 AM 

I'm trying to support my local independent bookstores by purchasing ebooks through them. Many of them use a system by Hummingbird Digital Media called MyMustReads. It really locks the access tightly, but I want to be able to read it on any of my devices. Do you have a solution for converting MyMustReads files? And for removing their DRM?  
 Many thanks!

[How to remove drm from kindle cloud reader?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/reader/) \-- 4/15/2019 1:58:49 PM 

How to remove drm from kindle cloud reader? I can download and pin book from Kindle cloud reader and also find these files. Is there any way to remove the DRM from these files?

[Free trial?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/14/2019 3:27:54 AM 

I was looking to test the epubor product by converting an .aax file to mp3\. It only converted 10 minutes, which is understandable under a free trial basis. However, I need to know how it will parse a 10 hour audio book .aax. Will it break it up into 10 minute segments? Will it break it up into chapters as audible does? What??

[Epubor for iPad?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 12/28/2020 5:53:36 PM 

Currently you must use the epubor converter application on a desktop (converter app isn’t compatible with iPad), correct? I purchased epubor ultimate and it’s been awesome - I convert using desktop then upload files to cloud to access on iPad (just wondered if I could further streamline by doing the actual conversion on the iPad). Thanks!

[Full content did not download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/10/2019 11:20:24 AM 

The drm removal and file conversion was successful through the kindle 1.17 software on windows 10, however half the book's content is missing, only 143 out of 300 something pages. I tried deleting and going through the process twice, into epub and pdf, nothing works. 

[Epubor DRM removal doesn't recognize my Kindle files](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/16/2016 11:15:13 PM 

I sync my Kindle files via Kindle app and get some "fragment files" not azw format. Epubor Kindle DRM removal cannot recognize it. Is this the new format of Kindle files? I just want to decrypt some Kindle files. 

[limitations of trial version](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/30/2019 2:11:12 AM 

Is the trial version limited?  
 I have an audio book file that should be several hours long; the converted mp3 version consists only of the first short chapter, 10 minutes long

 thank you for your time
