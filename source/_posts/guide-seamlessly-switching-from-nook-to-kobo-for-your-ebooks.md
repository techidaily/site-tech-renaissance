Barnes and Noble introduced Nook App to compete with Adobe Digital Editions. It can access your purchased books in your Nook library. But you cannot put all your Nook eBooks on other readers such as Kobo eReader because a part of Nook ebooks are protected with Nook DRM while ADE doesn't support the B&N DRM scheme. 

Kobo Inc totally adopts Adobe Adept DRM. In other words, you can read Kobo books on Nook. However, If you load Nook eBooks (EPUB or PDF) to Kobo eReader, the Nook DRM must be removed at first in order that you can open and read the Nook ebooks on Kobo.

This guide will show you how to remove DRM directly from B&N EPUB files and read Nook eBooks on Kobo.
