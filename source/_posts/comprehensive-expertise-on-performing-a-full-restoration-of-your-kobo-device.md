When your Kobo have issues, resetting is one of the most common methods to fix the device. But before rebooting your Kobo, you must know there are two types of resetting, one is soft reset, also known as restart; another is factory reset, also known as reboot. Knowing the differences will help you choose the right solution to fix the Kobo device. 

**Soft Reset (Restart)**: A soft reset means compulsory restart your Kobo device. It's is very easy to perform and will not delete data and books on your Kobo device.

**Factory Reset (Reboot)**: Factory reset means reverts your Kobo device's to its original state. If you perform a factory reset on your eReader, you'll remove all data and informations from your eReader. But books you purchased from Kobo can be re-downloaded from the Kobo Cloud. 

Factory reset will even let you lose any bookmarks and annotations you made in your books since you last synced your eReader. Sign out of your account on your eReader. Reset all of your settings and preferences. After a factory reset, you’ll have to set up and sync your eReader again.

Here is a troubleshooting list for your reference:

1. Kobo won't turn on, charge - Soft Reset
2. Can't transfer books to Kobo - Soft Reset
3. Can't connect to WiFi - Soft Reset
4. Can't connect to wireless networks - Soft Resst
5. Kobo locked up, screen frozen, or not responding - Soft Reset
6. Books or documents disappeared - Soft Reset
7. Kobo running slowly - Soft Reset
8. Computer not recognizing Kobo - Soft Reset
9. Continues to malfunction after restarting - Factory Reset
10. Kobo freezes during reboot - Factory Reset.

**Notes:** Always remember, soft reset is the first step to fix most of Kobo issues, but if it failed, and there is no other way to solve this issue, try to perform factory reset. And before perform factory reset, please [backup your books and documents on Kobo device.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

Do not do a factory reset on a Kobo arc 7 hd. What happens is it tries look for updates and does go into a code error 3\. Phone support they know there's a problem and have no solution. Your tablet is now toast.

Hello. 

 I have the original BASIC 2010 Kobo device & my screen has frozen: I cannot turn the page, exit, turn the device off or do anything with it. Spoke to WH Smith (as it is their product) & Kobo support but both say that they have no idea how to reset it, no one has apparently been 'trained' on the original model - can you help in any way please?   
 I do not want to lose ANY of the books (as most have been bought not free downloads), bookmarks or info stored on the device but I really need it to work for me again please.

 Thank you in advance for any help you may be able to give me

 With kindest regards

 Kara xx

For me (Kobo arc 10 HD, freezes on booting), I had to keep Volume Down pressed while booting to get into recovery mode till the cogs appeared. Reboot didn't work, cleared cache next time, still no functioning reboot just a blue screen with kobo while starting up. So I chose wipe data/factory reset. Booting finally functioned, Starting all from scratch now, I wonder if this also speeds up the tablet....
