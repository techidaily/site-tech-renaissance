Close

##  How Does Cloud Gaming With Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Work?

 An Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription ($16.99 per month) includes access to the[ Xbox Cloud Gaming platform](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/cloud-gaming) , which lets you play your favorite console games from various devices, including Windows, Android, iPhone, iPad, and Samsung smart TVs.

 All the games on the Xbox Cloud Gaming platform are hosted on remote servers. You stream the games to your device, which means you don't have to own an Xbox system. All you need is a compatible internet-connected device and a data connection fast enough for streaming.

 The Xbox Cloud Gaming platform hosts hundreds of games. You can use Bluetooth or USB-connected controllers.

 If you’re using Xbox Cloud Gaming on an iPhone or iPad, you’ll access the service through Safari and control games with touch controls (where available) or an iOS-compatible controller. For iOS devices, Microsoft recommends two controllers (both are $99):[ Backbone One for iOS](https://www.xbox.com/accessories/mobile-gaming/backbone-one) and[ Razer Kishi Universal Gaming Controller for iOS](https://www.razer.com/mobile-controllers/razer-kishi) .

 Xbox's Cloud Gaming platform is similar to Nvidia's GeForce Now service and Amazon Luna. Both let you play high-end games while on the move through smartphones and tablets. However, with thousands of data centers at its disposal, Microsoft's service avoids the speed and latency issues that have plagued some services in recent times.

##  How Do I Use Cloud Gaming With Xbox Game Pass Ultimate?

 If you're on an iPhone or iPad,[ visit the Xbox Cloud Gaming website](https://www.xbox.com/play) to play. Other devices can use that same link to access Cloud Gaming, but the browser matters: Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Google Chrome are the supported browsers.

 There's also an app for Windows and Android that you can use to play Xbox games remotely. Just sign in with your Game Pass Ultimate credentials to get started.

[ Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamepass) 

[ Windows ](https://www.xbox.com/apps/xbox-app-for-pc) 

 The Windows app works on Windows 10 October 2020 Update or later, so that includes Windows 11.

##  Do I Need an Xbox Game Console?

 The point of cloud gaming with Xbox Cloud Gaming and an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription is that anyone can stream games directly from the cloud, even if they don't own an Xbox console. If you do have one, however, your subscription also gives you access to games for your console.

##  Are There Any Downsides to Cloud Gaming With Xbox Game Pass Ultimate?

 A strong internet connection is required to stream Xbox games. Microsoft recommends 20 Mbps ([ here's how to do a speed test](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-test-your-internet-speed-2617987) ) but higher is better when it comes to streaming, especially multiplayer games.

 If you're somewhere with a poor internet connection or you are restricted in how much data you can use each month, a mobile game streaming service might not be a great idea. You may be limited in what you can accomplish, or you could be charged a lot more by your ISP compared to simply buying an Xbox console. 

 There may also be lag issues, as the system depends on your internet connection. In particular, when playing against other players, some slowdown issues might affect playability.

 You can't play Xbox Game Pass games offline. Your device must be connected to the internet at all times.
