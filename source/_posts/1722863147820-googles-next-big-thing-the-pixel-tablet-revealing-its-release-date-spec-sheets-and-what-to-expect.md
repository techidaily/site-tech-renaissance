## Google Tablet Features

 One huge reason the Pixel Tablet is unique compared to other tablets is the Hub Mode. When you're not walking around with it, you can dock it to instantly turn it into a smart display.

 From there, it can function as a digital photo frame, smart home controller, or of course, Google Assistant device. Use it to play music and videos, hop on Google Meet video calls, set timers, etc.

 The Pixel Tablet also has built-in Chromecast, so all those videos and audio streams you're used to casting to your TV or smart speaker can also be played on the tablet.

 Google says that the web browsing also gets a "new look and feel" in its tablet. Here are some highlights of the Chrome experience on the Pixel Tablet:

* Side-by-side design that makes finding the right tab easier.
* Tap groups to organize related tabs.
* Auto-scroll back feature to help you swipe back to your previous tab when working between two tabs.
* Hidden close button when tabs get too small, to prevent accidental closing.
* Tabs in grid format with a preview to help with quicker navigation.
* Drag-and-drop images, text, and links out of Chrome and into other apps like Keep, Gmail, or Photos.
* Force desktop mode for certain sites.

 Here are some other notable features:

* Control your smart home without unlocking your tablet.
* Nearby Share lets you push media, contacts, and more between the tablet and your other nearby Android devices.
* Remove distractions in the background of your pictures with Magic Eraser (built-in to Google Photos).
