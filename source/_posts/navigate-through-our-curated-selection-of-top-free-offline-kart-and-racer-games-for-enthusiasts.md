## Navigate Through Our Curated Selection of Top Free Offline Kart & Racer Games for Enthusiasts

Close 

 One of the best innovations in free car racing video games has been the addition of online leaderboards, multiplayer races, and even persistent open worlds for players to explore in their virtual cars.

 However, these exciting features have a cost in that their implementation requires that the games be online at all times to function correctly.

 Thankfully, several good offline racing games are still worth playing on smartphones, tablets, computers, and gaming consoles. Here are ten free offline titles worth downloading today.

 What We Like

* Focus on drifting sets this game apart.
* Cool music with a high production value.

 What We Don't Like

* Casual gamers will find this game hard or frustrating.
* Main menu can be a bit confusing to navigate at first.

_CarX Drift Racing 2_ features a realistic visual style that resembles the_Forza_ and_Asphalt_ car racing games but sets itself apart by its challenging driving style that incorporates slippery roads and requires frequent drifting to make it to the finish line.

 Naturally, online multiplayer is unavailable while offline, but the Drift, Time Attack, and Training modes are fully accessible and provide a lot of content for those who like this particular driving style.
