 This DLL file is part of the[MinGW](https://mingw.osdn.io/) (Minimalist GNU for Windows) development environment.

 The mingwm10.dll error message could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's[operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) , including[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) ,[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) ,[Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) ,[Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) ,[Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , and Windows 2000.

## How to Fix Mingwm10.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Do not download mingwm10.dll from a DLL download website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore mingwm10.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" mingwm10.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Edit the Windows PATH variable](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm) and add the MinGW bin folder, likely this path (but check your installation to verify):  
 `C:\MinGW\bin`  
If you know that MinGW isn't installed, see Step 4 below.
3. [Reinstall the program that uses the mingwm10.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides this file, if possible, is a likely solution to this error.
4. [Download and install MinGW](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/) if the previous step didn't fix the DLL error.  
 When you open this program after the installation, you'll use MinGW Installation Manager to install**mingw32-base-bin** . Mark the box next to that entry in the list, and then go to**Installation** \>**Apply Changes** to install it and, by extension, download mingwm10.dll.  
![MinGW Installation Manager and mingwm10.dll file in bin folder](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9X3XkuW-Ca0Nyt6L4og4NQKmS1M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/mingw-installation-manager-dll-bin-folder-3b288df647b348c49c16352e032bb1de.png)
5. Search your computer for the mingwm10.dll file. If you find it (it'll probably be in the same path shown above, in Step 2),[copy it to the folder](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-copy-a-file-in-windows-2619210) that contains the program that's prompting the missing DLL error.  
[8 Best Free File Search Tools](https://www.lifewire.com/11-free-file-search-tools-1356644)
6. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some mingwm10.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the mingwm10.dll error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
7. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the mingwm10.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
8. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to mingwm10.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file mingwm10.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
 The mingwm10.dll file may or may not be related to video cardsâ€”this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
9. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if mingwm10.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
10. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other[patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The mingwm10.dll file could be included in one of those updates, or a Windows update could be necessary for this DLL file to work properly.
11. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . I've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause mingwm10.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
12. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual mingwm10.dll file troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
13. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair mingwm10.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid mingwm10.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners. They're included here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
14. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the mingwm10.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during this step. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the mingwm10.dll error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
15. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any mingwm10.dll errors persist. After a clean installation of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.
