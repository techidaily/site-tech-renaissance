## What Are Sticky Keys?

 Every keyboard uses modifier keys, which change the function of a letter key. The one you probably use most often is**Shift** . Under normal circumstances, with Sticky Keys off, you'd need to press and hold**Shift** as you press the**8** key, for example, to create an asterisk.

 Sticky Keys assist people with disabilities or who suffer from repetitive stress injuries. Turning this feature on effectively_sticks_ the key in the pressed position, letting you use shortcut keys one press at a time.

 To return to the asterisk example, having Sticky Keys on would mean you could press**Shift** , let go of it, and then press**8** to type the asterisk. The same is true for any other shortcut that uses the**Ctrl** ,**Alt** , or**Windows key** .

 Sticky keys can be useful if you don't like holding down a key for long periods of time. If you're not a touch-typist, in particular, or if you're learning how to use software that makes heavy use of modifier keys, it can be useful while you track down which key you want to press. Otherwise, they're probably not worth leaving on.
