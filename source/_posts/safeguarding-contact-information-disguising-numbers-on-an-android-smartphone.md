### What to Know

* Typing**\*67** before the number lets you block your caller ID for outgoing calls.
* Some carriers let you enable**Hide number** in the Phone app.
* If all else fails, call your carrier and ask them to make your phone number private.

 This article walks you through a few different ways to make your number private so that when you call someone, your phone number isn't displayed on their caller ID.

## A Quick No Caller ID Trick: \*67

 One of the quickest and easiest ways to hide your number from the person you're calling is to[use the *67 trick](https://www.lifewire.com/hide-your-number-with-star-67-4154833) . Doing that will make your number show up to the recipient as "Private" or "Blocked." You'll have to do it manually for every call you make, though, because you can't automate it.

 If you found your number on a phone finder website, you can[delete your personal information from that site](https://www.lifewire.com/remove-personal-information-from-internet-3482691) to hide your number.

## Use the Hide Number No Caller ID Trick

 Some Android devices and[mobile carriers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mobile-carrier-2373339) offer the option of hiding your number by default, making it unnecessary to input \*67 every time you make a call. Here's how to block your cell phone number using your phone's built-in**Hide number** feature:

1. Open the**Phone** app (it's called**Telephone** on some devices).
2. Select the**three-dot** menu icon in the top-right of the window.
3. Select**Settings** .

## Ask Your Carrier to Block Your Number Directly

 If your phone doesn't include the option to hide your caller ID, your service provider might. If they don't offer an app for blocking your caller ID, try reaching out over their support line.

 For example,[Verizon users can block their caller ID](https://www.verizon.com/support/caller-id-block-faqs/) using the[My Verizon app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vzw.hss.myverizon) . If you're an AT&T customer, they recommend[contacting AT&T Wireless support](https://www.att.com/support/wireless/) ; caller ID blocking is free for all users.

## Use a Burner Number

 If none of the above solutions work for you, you can[buy a prepaid phone](https://www.lifewire.com/how-prepaid-phones-work-5076218) , often referred to as a burner or disposable number.

[Google Voice](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-voice-1616888) is another option. It provides you with a[second phone number](https://www.lifewire.com/best-second-phone-number-apps-4842373) for free with which you can make anonymous calls.

## Limitations to Hiding Your Phone Number

 There are some calls that you can't hide your number from. Toll-free and 911 emergency services will always be able to see your number, whatever you do. Some third-party applications can allow someone to get around any number obfuscation you put in place, so none of these methods are guaranteed.
