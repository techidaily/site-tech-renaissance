## Causes of Vizio TV Not Connecting to Wi-Fi

 When you first set up your smart TV, you must[connect the Vizio TV to Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-connect-vizio-tv-to-wi-fi-4589237) before you can use any of the[Vizio apps](https://www.lifewire.com/add-manage-apps-vizio-tv-4172016) like Netflix and Hulu. If the TV can't access the internet, it could be due to a few reasons:

* General network connection problems.
* Temporary issues with the TV or router's memory.
* The TV is using the wrong Wi-Fi settings.
* Problems with the TV's Wi-Fi adapter.

 To test the connection, go to**Menu** \>**Network** , or**Settings** , and then select**Test Connection** . If a download speed appears, it means the TV is connected to the internet.

## How to Fix It When a Vizio TV Can't Connect to Wi-Fi

 Try these steps in order until your Vizio smart TV connects to your Wi-Fi network:

1. [Check the Wi-Fi network](https://www.lifewire.com/troubleshooting-no-wireless-connection-2378241) . Access the web from another device connected to your network. If it works, then the problem lies with the television. If you can't connect from any device, you need to troubleshoot the network.
2. Unplug the TV. After about 30 seconds, turn the TV back on and see if it connects.  
 Leaving the TV unplugged clears its internal memory and helps resolve any software glitches that might result in poor connectivity.
3. [Restart the router](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570) . Similar to rebooting the TV, power cycling the router clears out its memory and can be a simple fix for a TV that won't connect to Wi-Fi.
4. Update the Wi-Fi password on the TV. This is only relevant if you changed your Wi-Fi password recently. Your TV must have the correct password to your network before it can reach the internet.  
 To do this, open the network settings (**Menu** \>**All Settings** \>**Network** on some TVs), then select the network you want to connect to and type its password. Press**Connect** to put your TV back online.
5. [Toggle DHCP on or off](https://vizhdtv.com/5-simple-steps-what-to-do-when-your-vizio-smart-tv-wont-connect-to-the-internet/#toggledhcp) . This option is available through the menu on the TV, in the**Network** settings. If[DHCP](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-dhcp-2625848) is currently off, turn it on. If it's already on, switch it off for a few seconds and then turn it back on.
6. [Change the router's security settings](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-encrypt-your-wireless-network-2487653) . Your TV may require a specific type of encryption, such as WPA-PSK (TKIP). You might need to consult your TV's user manual to know what to change this to, or you can try different settings to see what works for your TV.  
 If the router is provided by your[internet service provider](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924) , you may need to call them and ask how to change the security settings. However, you can skip this step if your TV has been working fine up until now and you haven't made any changes to your router.
7. Switch to a wired connection. If the TV has an[Ethernet port](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546) , connect it directly to the router or modem with an[Ethernet cable](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable-817548) . If this fixes the problem, then the TV's wireless adapter could be broken.
8. Reset the TV to its factory settings. Once complete, the television will turn itself off and then come back on at the original setup screen.  
 To do this, open the**Menu** and go to**Admin & Privacy** \>**Reset to Factory Settings** .  
 Resetting your TV will cause you to lose all saved apps, preferences, usernames, and passwords.
9. [Contact Vizio customer support](https://support.vizio.com/s/contact-us) . You can reach out to Vizio via text, email, or phone. If your TV is under warranty, you might be able to get it serviced or replaced.
