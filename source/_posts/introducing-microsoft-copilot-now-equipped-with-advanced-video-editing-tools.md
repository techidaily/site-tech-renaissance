## Introducing Microsoft Copilot: Now Equipped with Advanced Video Editing Tools

Microsoft is developing a new video creation skill for Microsoft Copilot. Tell the AI what you want, and it'll automatically assemble a video with stock footage, music, voiceovers, and more in Clipchamp.

 This isn't a Hollywood-busting video _generation_ feature. Really, the only thing that Copilot will generate is a script. From there, it'll tap into [Clipchamp's](https://fox-http.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-iphone-photography-handbook-tips-and-tricks/) collection of premade video templates, royalty-free footage, and text-to-speech generator to assemble a project file. You can treat this project like a "first draft" and continue editing it in Clipchamp. Or, if the video's fine as-is, you can export it without any changes.

 The video creation feature, which should begin its rollout in September, is briefly described in the [Microsoft 365 product roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&searchterms=video%2Cdrafting). It's unclear whether the feature will require a paid Clipchamp account (which is included with Microsoft 365).

> "Clipchamp brings video creation skills to Copilot. Type your prompt and Clipchamp will write a bespoke script, source high quality stock footage, and assemble a video project with music, voiceover, text overlays and transitions. Open your video project draft in the Clipchamp app to continue to edit, export, and share. This feature is great for informational videos, video messaging, how-to videos, demos, and video presentations."

 Clipchamp has some great capabilities, including chroma-key (green screen) support and social media integration. Still, it's just a lightweight video editor, and it's primarily intended for corporate presentations, graduation videos, informational guides, and other simple stuff.

 Most people who use Clipchamp do not know how to edit videos or obtain stock footage. So, Clipchamp appeals to those users with automated features and hassle-free assets. This Copilot integration builds on Clipchamp's core functionality and appeal, and as a result, it doesn't feel forced or shoehorned (although my opinion may change when I test the feature later this year).

 Microsoft says that Copilot Clipchamp integration will begin rolling out in September 2024\. Interestingly, the Microsoft 365 roadmap makes no mention of a beta testing period. The new feature may skip Insider channels and jump straight to general availability.
