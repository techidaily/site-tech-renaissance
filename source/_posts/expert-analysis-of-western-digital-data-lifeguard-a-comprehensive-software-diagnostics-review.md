## Ultimate List of Free Preschool Activities â€“ Play & Learn with These Fantastic Resources
 Computer games can be a fantastic resource for keeping young children engaged and entertained while also helping them develop essential skills.

 We have kids and researched several games to determine which ones are most educational as well as plain old fun. These games focus on teaching the alphabet, counting, memorizing, and other academic and practical abilities.

 We've found that introducing our children to learning through play in various ways at a young age can help foster a lifelong love of learning; it also doesn't hurt (sometimes) to keep them busy for a few minutes so we can get work done.
