Android eReader app is playing an important role among various android apps. [We have posted "How to Read DRM EPUB books on Android Tablet / Phone"](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) before, and with more and more people reading eBooks on tablets and phones, nowadays, people desperately find it indispensible to install additional android eReader apps on their android devices such as Kindle, Nook or any others. That results from different eBook formats and the DRM restrictions. Anyway, having a good android eReader app on your android tablet or eReader is inevitable.

This article covers best android eReader apps, most of which support DRMed EPUB/PDF. Official apps like Kindle for Android, Nook for Android etc are not introduced here as they are provided for certain purposes and you can download them from the official websites as you like. Now let's have a look at the best android reading apps.

I am so glad that you have got a good reading app.Most android eReader apps listed in this article support drm but wordplayer doesn't.Furthermore,it does not support various eBook formats without Calibre, which can be achieved easily by Cool Reader or others.  
 Anyway, thanks for sharing your experience here.

I love your site, thank you!!   
 I just bought a Nexus 7 for my wife. I want to set it up for ebooks from our local library.  
  
 It would be helpful if your site offered a flow chart of the steps required to reach a certain goal; I.E. "Set up a Nexus 7 to read free ebooks (Overdrive)from public libraries". What are the sequential steps?

 Your site is great!! Thanks again, aldous

Hi Aldous,  
 We are pretty happy for your kind words.   
 If you have got a Nexus 7 and want to read books in it, we have another article tells you how to do this: <http://www.epubor.com/read-ebooks-on-nexus-7.html>

 And for the OverDrive, we will compile a detailed guide about about how to use it in the future.

 Thanks

Try Infinity Reader from GooglePlay  
  
 The reader supports audio, video, scripts and all EPUB3 features. The reader comes with a free book, which contains youtube video. You can download a lot of free books from the reader.

I'll recommend Reasily and Lithium for DRM-free EPUB books. They both support many EPUB3 features and very fast. Able to highlight and take note. Reasily can even sync notes to Google Drive. Also it can open multiple books at the same time as if the books are different apps.
