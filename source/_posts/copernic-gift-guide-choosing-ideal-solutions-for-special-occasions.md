## Top Tips for Optimizing Menu Functionality on Leading Networks – Learn to Efficiently Scroll & Manage Content on Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube

You’re likely familiar with search fields and using them to refine a search for a particular subject or file. This article discusses different search operators you can use to help with more complex queries.

**AND (+)**

 Using AND in the search field will return files that contain all keywords listed. It is important to not overuse the AND operator as searches that are too specific can overlook relevant results.

**OR**

Use OR to locate files that have at least one of the listed keywords.

**NOT (-)**

 NOT will eliminate files that contain the specified word. It is important to be aware that using this search operator risks eliminating relevant documents. It might also eliminate words within words during a search (i.e. eliminating “book” could remove files containing the word “cookbook” as well).

**NEAR**

 Using NEAR will provide files that contain the keywords within ten words of each other.
