## What Is Voice Guide on Samsung TVs?

 Voice Guide is a voice assistant feature for Samsung smart TVs which works like VoiceOver on Mac or Narrator on Windows. Itâ€™s a type of screen reader that automatically narrates text on the screen, like menu options and descriptions of movies and TV shows. It also provides an audio cue whenever you switch between connected devices.

 If you have trouble reading words on your TV, Voice Guide can make it easier for you to navigate menus, switch input devices, and choose what to watch. In addition to the options to turn this feature on and off, you can also adjust the speed, volume, and pitch of the voice.
