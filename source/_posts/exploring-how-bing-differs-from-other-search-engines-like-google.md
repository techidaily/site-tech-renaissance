 Pros

* Pick up in person or have it shipped
* Sign up for service, too
* Filter results to find only discounted phones
* Easily compare multiple phones' specs

 Cons

* Missing a filter option for RAM

 Best Buy is an excellent option for buying a new smartphone online or in stores. You can even request a new smartphone from the online store, have it set aside in your local Best Buy brick-and-mortar, and pick it up the same day.

 Best Buy has an outstanding selection of smartphones and cell phones, including budget phones and today’s highest-end handsets. Better yet, it’s an authorized reseller for major US carriers, so if you want to sign up for a new Verizon or AT&T account, for instance, you can do it at Best Buy without ever needing to head to a carrier location.

 Best Buy’s on-site staff is knowledgeable; the company gets new smartphones on launch days and often offers sales.

 Pros

* Good for finding affordable phones
* Lots of useful filtering options to find what you want
* Frequent limited-time deals

 Cons

* Can't easily compare multiple phones at once

 Amazon focuses on cheaper handsets that appeal to a mass audience of people on a budget who don’t like spending $1,000 on a new smartphone. And since most devices come with free shipping, you can quickly get your hands on a new phone from the company when you order online.

 Interestingly, Amazon doesn’t have an exhaustive smartphone collection under the sun. Granted, the site allows you to find a slew of phones from companies like LG, Asus, and even several Chinese vendors, but if you’re looking for a brand-new iPhone or Samsung Galaxy device, Amazon is sometimes a little late to the game.

 But if you’re looking for affordable smartphones, Amazon is well worth a look.

[View on Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/)

 Pros

* Might be more affordable to shop here
* Buy online or in the store
* Wide selection

 Cons

* Can't sort by customer rating

 Walmart bridges the gap between Best Buy and Amazon.

 Like Amazon, Walmart is a go-to spot for budget-friendly smartphones and basic cell phones. But it also sells new devices at the higher end of the spectrum, like Apple’s iPhones and Samsung Galaxy smartphones. And since Walmart has some leverage in its negotiations with smartphone makers, you’ll often find that its devices are available at a slight discount compared to some of the competition.

 Aside from that, Walmart is a top choice for convenience since the company has both an online presence and brick-and-mortar locations. And since its stores are in so many places, it shouldn’t be difficult to find what you want, when you want.

[View on Apple](https://www.apple.com/)

 Pros

* Preferrable for Apple fans
* Helpful staff

 Cons

* Limited to iPhones, unlike most retailers

 The Apple Store is the place to be if you’re an iPhone fan.

 Apple has one of the best retail experiences in this roundup. Its stores are well-designed, its staff is highly knowledgeable, and if you want to fix your iPhone, going to the Apple Store is your best bet.

 If you buy a new iPhone on launch day, Apple’s stores have the most inventory and are the most likely to have the unit you want. Add that to an outstanding online store that ships quickly and cheaply, and Apple is to choose if you’re team iPhone.

 Pros

* Multiple payment options
* In-store and online shopping
* Smart way to get rid of your old phone

 Cons

* Unlikely you'll find great deals

 Although not all major wireless carriers—AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile—offer the same slate of devices or have the same plans, they generally deliver a standard shopping experience.

 When you walk into a carrier store, you can, in most cases, toss out any chance of getting a great deal on a new smartphone. But you can expect the carriers to offer you a variety of ways to buy the handset, including paying upfront or via monthly installments. And if you’re a new customer, you can ask the salespeople if there’s an opportunity to take advantage of cheaper pricing by signing up for a new line.

 Carriers are increasingly expanding their product lines, so you could also go to the location to buy accessories. And just in case you don’t want to go to a store, all major carriers offer outstanding online marketplaces that help you quickly buy your latest and greatest smartphone.

 Pros

* Decent collection of older phones
* Frequent deals

 Cons

* Relatively smaller selection

 J.D. Power ranks shopping experiences yearly among significant carriers and smaller, prepaid wireless carriers. And each year, some, like Boost Mobile, Cricket Wireless, and others, outrank their larger counterparts.

 Going to a prepaid wireless carrier to buy a new phone might be the way to go.

 Prepaid carriers generally offer solid prices on their plans and far more flexibility in structuring your deals than primary carriers. Although prepaid carriers typically have a more extensive stock of cheap smartphones, if you want a new iPhone or top-notch Android device, you can go to a prepaid carrier and get what you want.

 Be aware, however, that prepaid carriers rely on major carrier networks to deliver their service. So be sure to check which carriers prepaid companies depend on to see if you have good coverage in your area.
