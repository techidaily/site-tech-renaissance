On July 24th, 2013, Google announced its new Android tablet – the new Nexus 7\. It came out with the latest Android 4.3 and a series of improvement on hardware configuration. As the original Nexus 7 is no longer listed at Google Play Store, it's natural to associate the new Nexus 7 with Google's the other Android tablet – the Nexus 10\. Is this new star product qualified for challenging the top level Nexus 10? Should we buy the new Nexus 7 or Nexus 10? This article will give you a brief comparison between these two tablets and it will help you to make a decision.

1 Appearance 

| |  **Dimensions** | **Weight**             |                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **New Nexus 7**   | 114 x 200 x 8.65 mm    | 290g(Wi-Fi), 290g(LTE) |
| **Nexus 10**      | 263.9 x 177.6 x 8.9 mm | 603 g                  |

From the table we can see that the Nexus 10 is much bigger and heavier than the new Nexus 7\. It's nearly twice as length and weight. This makes the Nexus 10 not easy to handle, at least, it's not very suitable for kids. If you use Nexus 10 for game playing, I'm sure your hands will get tired for over time. It's better for watching video. On the contrary, the new Nexus 7 is thinner and lighter. You can put it in your bag easily and hold it with little effort. It's more portable and can be treat as a real mobile device. The new soft coating rear cover makes it feel great when handling.

2 Display & screen 

| **New nexus 7**                                                                    | **Nexus 10**                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7.02" 1920x1200 HD display (323 ppi) 1080p HD IPS Scratch resistant Corning? glass | 10.055 " 2560 x 1600 (300 ppi) WQXGA True RGB Real Stripe PLS Corning? Gorilla? Glass 2 |

Display size is the main difference between the two tablets. Nexus 7 has a resolution of 2560\*1600\. It has the highest resolution on tablet, even higher than iPad 4's 2048\*1536\. But the Nexus7 has a higher 323 ppi as it has a smaller 7 inch display. Both of them can render sharp image and has excellent color rendition. Benefit from high ppi, you can read sharper text and image on the new Nexus 7\. For game playing, 7 inch is a great size as you have wide game screen and enough operating space. But if you like watching video or reading e-books (especially PDF e-book), Nexsu 10 is a better choice as it provides a wider visual field.

3 Processing unit 

| **New nexus 7**                                                                    | **Nexus 10**                                                                    |

| **CPU**: Quad-core 1.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro **GPU**: Adreno 320, 400MHz s | **CPU**: Dual-core A15 Samsung 1.7 GHz Exynos 5250 **GPU**: Quad-core Mali TS04 |

Although Nexus only has a dual-core CPU, it still has a very strong performance as the Exynos 5250 is Cortex – A15 architecture. It's more advanced than the A9 – A15 Snapdragon S4 Pro. As the Snapdragon S4 Pro is quad-core design, the two CPUs don't have much performance difference. But as for power consumption, the new Nexus 7 is better as the Snapdragon S4 pro adopts a 28nm manufacturing technique.

![new-nexus-7-vs-nexus-10-exynos-5250](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/5-new-nexus-7-vs-nexus-10-exynos-5250.jpg)

The quad-core Mali TS04 has much stronger parameter than Adreno 320\. But the latter has better game effect in actual. This is due the fact that most Android games are optimized for the Qualcomm Adreno GPU and they have specialized data package. If you like playing games very much, I suggest you choose the new Nexus 7.

4 Connectivity & network 

| **New nexus 7**                                                                                         | **Nexus 10**                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4G/5G) 802.11 a/b/g/nNFC (Android Beam)Bluetooth 4.0Optional 4G LTEWireless charging | Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n (MIMO+HT40)Dual side NFCBluetoothMagnetic Pogo pin chargerNo 3G/4G option |

We could find out the main difference is the network and charging mode. The Nexus 10 doesn't have 3G/4g option. That means it's better for home using. This a pity but explainable design – the Nexus 10 is too big and heavy. Seldom people will take it out and most use it at home. So you just need a Wi-Fi connection. You may notice that the new Nexus 7 supports a dual-band Wi-Fi – 2.4G and 5G. The 2.4G band is very common in our daily use and the 5G is a fresh thing. Although the 5G Wi-Fi is very fast and has strong wireless signal than before, it hasn't widely used yet.

![new-nexus-7-vs-nexus-10-4g-lte](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/7-new-nexus-7-vs-nexus-10-4g-lte.jpg)

The magnetic pin charger makes Nexus 10 charge easier. You don't need to plug the cable in a tiny micro USB port. But new Nexus 7 is obviously more advanced in charging mode - it adopts wireless charging! This design makes us no longer enslaved to cable. Just put the new Nexus7 around the wireless charger and it will get charged. No cable is needed.

5 Price 

| New Nexus 7(16GB Wi-Fi) | New Nexus 7(32GB Wi-Fi) | New Nexus 7(32GB LTE) | Nexus 10(16GB Wi-Fi) | Nexus10(32GB Wi-Fi) |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| $229                    | $269                    | $349                  | $399                 | $499                |

The most expensive new Nexus 7 sells $349, even cheaper than the cheapest Nexus 10\. Personally speaking I think the new Nexus7 has more advantage in price. In fact, Nexus 10 is just better for watching video and reading books. Its large size makes it not portable. Considering the portability and game compatibility, I think new Nexus 7 is a better choice.
