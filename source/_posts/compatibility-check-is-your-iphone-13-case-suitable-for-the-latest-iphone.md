Just months ago, Apple announced a string of [artificial intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/) (AI) updates to its operating systems in one of its most jam-packed WWDC keynotes. For the iPhone, Apple unveiled [iOS 18](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-the-biggest-iphone-changes-apple-announced-at-wwdc-2024/), now available [in public beta](https://www.zdnet.com/article/you-can-download-ios-18-public-beta-on-iphone-right-now-heres-how-and-which-models-support-it/), the latest iteration of the smartphone software. It includes enhanced AI integrations in Siri, [generative AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) capabilities in [Photos](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-photos-app-is-getting-an-ai-powered-editing-feature-to-wipe-out-photobombers/) and [Messages](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-generated-genmoji-solve-a-problem-weve-all-had-before/), and even updates to its Health and [Calculator](https://www.zdnet.com/article/after-14-years-apple-expected-to-unveil-the-ipad-app-weve-all-been-waiting-for-at-wwdc/) apps.

Apple removes one or two older iPhone models from its list of supported devices each time it releases a new iOS version, marking the end of those devices' software support cycle. Most of the [newest AI features](https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-every-iphone-model-that-will-support-apples-upcoming-ai-features-for-now/) are reserved for the [iPhone 15 Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-review/) and newer models, as they require the processing power of an A17 Pro chipset or newer and 8GB of RAM or higher, but iOS 18 will still be available for many older models. 

We've added guidance below on how to trade in your old iPhone and further specifics about iOS 18 Beta. Here's the list of supported iPhone models that can benefit from the newest operating system.

Notably, the once-popular iPhone X model is not on the list. Older devices like the iPhone 8 series also didn't make the cut this year. As for what's to come, Apple's new [iPhone 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-compared-which-iphone-should-you-buy-today/) lineup will launch with iOS 18 out of the box.

## When will iOS 18 be released?

Apple typically releases its new operating systems for public beta access a few weeks after WWDC. iOS 18 was released in public beta in mid-July. The public beta program lets users test developing software to pinpoint bugs and performance issues. This process lets software teams make any necessary fixes and releases before the new system reaches general availability.

Apple will likely release iOS 18 out of beta this fall, following the [September 9 "Glowtime" event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-we-expect-at-apples-iphone-16-event-ai-features-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-more/). The Apple Intelligence features will be available in stages for qualifying devices, as they're expected to roll out gradually over the coming year and into the next.

## What is a software beta?

A software beta is a version of a program or operating system initially released to a limited group of users to iron out bugs and gather feedback. The beta release lets a developer or company test its software program or system to emulate real-world use before a general release.

The beta phase follows alpha testing, where software is developed and tested internally within the company.

## iOS 18 beta vs full release: What's the difference?

The iOS 18 beta version differs from what we expect in this fall's general release. Beta testers are given a release that has recently exited its alpha phase, so problems and bugs are expected to arise. The purpose of the beta phase is to gather user feedback to repair these bugs and address any user interface issues before the software is massively distributed.

Beta versions can also be incomplete and not the final product, especially in the case of iOS 18, which didn't include Apple Intelligence features in the initial beta release. This status means the iOS 18 beta version is more prone to bugs, glitches, and instability.

The general release will have ironed out these bugs and problems using the user feedback gathered during the beta phase, delivering more complete software that won't be as prone to bugs. 

One example of this process is when Apple released the iOS 17 beta version in 2023\. The early beta version featured the 'End' button during a call that had moved from the center to the right, which was a big change for iPhone users. Disapproving feedback from beta testers resulted in [Apple moving the 'End' call button back to the center of the screen](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-moved-iphones-end-call-button-again-is-this-spot-less-weird/), where users had been accustomed to.

## What should you do with your outdated iPhone?

The Apple brand is strong and holds significant resale value, so you can always sell your older iPhone and disclose that it's no longer supported for software updates. There's a lot of demand for older iPhones that are still functional and budget-friendly, but you can also trade them for credit towards a new device.

**Also: [The best iPhone models of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/)**

Apple, Best Buy, and Amazon are just some retailers that accept iPhone trade-ins. iPhones' resale and trade-in values depend heavily on their condition and storage capacity. Features like an intact screen and a working camera greatly influence resale or trade-in values.

If you're looking to maintain or obtain a service provider, you can check your iPhone's trade-in value at one of these retailers or at an authorized dealer for a telecommunications company. 

## Which iPhone models will get Apple Intelligence?

While many iPhone models support iOS 18, very few will support Apple Intelligence, Apple's AI features. Apple Intelligence will be available in a beta version upon its release for the iPhone 15 Pro series and iPhone 16 series, as well as iPads and Macs with an M1 chip or later.

Apple Intelligence will be part of iOS 18, iPadOS18, and macOS Sequoia, but will be released over time.

## Which iPhone models will no longer be supported?

iOS 18 will not be supported in the iPhone X, iPhone 8, or earlier models. The new iOS version will only be available for iPhones sporting an A12 Bionic chip or newer.
