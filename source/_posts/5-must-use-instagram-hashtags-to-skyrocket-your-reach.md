## [Tried and True Navigation: Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/about)

![Google Maps Navigation App Best of 2018](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pbv4_ULoaGW9rtcU0ruj3WNVXx8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GoogleMaps-5c01b06e46e0fb00015b1530.jpg)

Google

 What We Like

* Saves frequent locations.
* Links to Google reviews for points of interest and recommendations.
* Download maps for areas where you're headed.
* Projects what time you should leave locations to make your next appointment.

 What We Don't Like

* Sometimes unsure which direction the user is traveling.
* It drains the battery.

 Google Maps is one of the most prominent traffic navigation apps. It's evolved over the years from a basic turn-by-turn service to warning of traffic events,[monitoring traffic in real time](https://www.lifewire.com/check-real-time-traffic-google-maps-7486702) , predicting when you should leave to arrive at that meeting stored in your calendar, and even sharing your location with friends.

 Google Maps isn't limited to drivers. Use the app to get walking, cycling, and public transit directions. Street View shows panoramic images of most locations.

 With_billions_ of downloads in the Google Play store, it's a solid choice for your navigation. If service is a concern, use the app to download offline maps.

**Download For:**

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/google-maps/id585027354)

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps)

![Waze traffic and navigation app for iOS](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zEwSa6rR_Y858jW05dVYm42D0os=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001-lifewire.combest-traffic-apps-4570916-cae0e49605f440f2a5a011091e262435.jpg)

 What We Like

* Voice controls for hands-free navigation and event reporting.
* Alerts-only mode for heads up on road hazards and police without turn-by-turn directions.
* Reports your ETA to friends and allows them to track your progress.

 What We Don't Like

* Music integration is neat but the widget can get in the way.
* Cluttered maps can be confusing.
* Battery drain higher than Google Maps.

[Waze vs. Google Maps: What's the Difference?](https://www.lifewire.com/waze-vs-google-maps-7495522)

 Now owned by Google, Waze has all the knowledge of Google Maps paired with user input on traffic conditions, road hazards, speed traps, and more. Additionally, it takes the calendar integration one step further. It checks your calendar, alerting you when you should leave to make your appointment on time based on current traffic. It can even[customize your voice options](https://www.lifewire.com/change-waze-voices-4177124) by recording your voice to give directions.

## [Offline Metropolitan Navigation: HERE WeGo](https://www.here.com/products/wego)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif" border="0"></a>

![HERE WeGo Navigation app](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/URZtLf93Vs_MCpK4Nq_a8jll2oA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003-best-traffic-apps-4570916--b327482f3e82498fb4225b9ead1034e3.jpg)

 What We Like

* Offline keeps you in the know even when you're on a subway or out of data.
* Choose from options like shortest distance or fastest in selecting your route.
* Public transportation information, including fares.
* Large, easy-to-see buttons.
* Avoid U-turns, toll roads, unpaved roads, tunnels, and more.

 What We Don't Like

* Voices are a little robotic-sounding.
* Does not automatically convert to your current location's units of measure if you travel.

 HERE WeGo is your go-to for city navigation, especially if you need access to maps offline. Live traffic and public transit information, fare information for public transportation, and recommendations for whether a bus or a cab is your best bet are all part of the app. There's also a really neat "door-to-door directions" toggle you can switch on for additional guidance, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are free to use. With public transport information for over 1,900 cities, this is the app to turn you into a professional city slicker.

![Apple Maps app on the iPad](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zcDj0-XetONog5hXIMhTTdOG_ug=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/apple-maps-ipad-7346f569f6ab421fae53cc8d7f0f4353.png)

 What We Like

* Attractive iOS-style interface.
* Receives regular updates.
* Integrates with Siri.
* Look Around feature.

 What We Don't Like

* Not available as an Android app.
* Offline access requires at least iOS 17.

 The Apple Maps app was late to the traffic-app party and had to deal with some bumps in the road before it became a worthy rival to Google Maps. Apple now offers improved maps, satellite imagery, city guides, and cycling navigation.

 This traffic app recommends travel times and routes based on your frequent locations and calendar. Maps also provides Yelp reviews and informational links for points of interest.

 Maps is pre-loaded on iPhone and iPad.[It's also available on the web](https://beta.maps.apple.com/) for other devices, but it's not as useful as the dedicated iOS app.

**Download For:**

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-maps/id915056765)

## [Global Navigation With Real Views and Heads Up Display: Sygic](https://www.sygic.com/gps-navigation)

![Sygic Navigation App Heads Up Display](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3SPT6wHKEVq-NEye08CmdP4kBX8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SYGIC-5c01ccfe46e0fb000159a8a7.jpg)

Sygic

 What We Like

* Great turn-by-turn navigation.
* Global user base and offline capabilities make this an excellent choice for navigation outside the U.S.
* Automatic Premium+ trial.
* Works as a dashcam app.

 What We Don't Like

* Lots of features hidden behind a monthly subscription.
* Android Auto and CarPlay connectivity cost.

 Sygic Navigation & Maps provides typical navigation app features, such as turn-by-turn directions and search functions, but it's also full of add-on perks. The base app is free, including offline options for downloading maps. Premium+ is where it's at if you want top features like speed limit information, lane assistant, no ads, speed camera alerts, and more.

**Download For:**

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/sygic-gps-navigation-maps/id585193266)

 What We Like

* Turn-by-turn directions and alternative routes based on live traffic conditions.
* Customize your vehicle icon.
* Can display points of interest while you drive.

 What We Don't Like

* Map data is not as robust as Google-based options.
* Outdated user interface.

 You might remember MapQuest as the program from the 1990s where you put in start and end locations andâwait for itâprinted out the directions to take in your car. MapQuest has progressed since then, providing a solid app for turn-by-turn navigation with handy features like favorite locations, layers for several points of interest, and night mode.

 What We Like

* Beautiful user interface.
* Estimates travel time for driving, walking, and transit.
* Includes Apple Watch complication.

 What We Don't Like
