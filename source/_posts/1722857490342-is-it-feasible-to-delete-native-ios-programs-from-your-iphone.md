## Read Receipts on iPhone

 On an iPhone, read receipts are the only way to tell if someone read a text you sent from Messages,[the default texting app for iOS](https://www.lifewire.com/imessage-apples-free-texting-app-1999185) . If you and your recipient activate read receipts, the word**Read** will be seen under the most recent message, along with the time the message was read.

 Here's how to enable or disable read receipts in Messages for iOS:

 Read receipts work only when both you and your recipient enable iMessage from the Messages settings. Read receipts don't work if you use SMS messaging or if your recipient doesn't use an iOS device.

1. Open**Settings** .
2. Tap**Messages** .
3. Turn on**Send Read Receipts** .
4. Others are notified when you read their messages. If your recipient also enabled read receipts, you'll see**Read** beneath your message along with the time it was read.

 If you don't want people to know that when you read their messages,[turn off read receipts on your iPhone or Android](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-read-receipts-on-or-off-on-iphone-and-android-5074420) .

## Read Receipts on Android Smartphones

 The process is similar on Android. The[Google Messages app](https://www.lifewire.com/use-android-messages-app-4177697) supports read receipts, but the carrier must also support this feature. Your recipient must have read receipts activated for you to see if they read your message.

 Here's how to turn on read receipts for an Android phone:

 The directions below should apply no matter who made your Android phone: Samsung, Google, Huawei, Xiaomi, etc. There may, however, be slight variations depending on the Android version.

1. Open the app and tap the settings option, called**Messages settings** on some devices. If you don't see this, tap the profile image or the three vertical dots or lines at the top of the screen.
2. Depending on your phone, tap**RCS chats** ,**Chat features** , **Text Messages** , or **Conversations** . If this option isn't on the first page that displays, tap **More settings** .
3. Tap the toggle next to the read receipts options, which might be called**Send read receipts** ,**Read receipts** , or**Request receipt** , depending on the device you have.

## WhatsApp Read Receipts

 WhatsApp uses built-in read receipts. The status of sent messages[is tracked through check marks next to messages](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-track-messages-with-whatsapp-check-marks-4781495) . One grey check mark means the message was sent; two grey check marks mean the message was delivered, and two blue check marks mean the message was read.

 Read receipts are turned on by default, but it's a toggle you can switch on and off. If you've turned off[WhatsApp read receipts](https://www.lifewire.com/whatsapp-read-receipts-ticks-3426871) , follow that guide to learn how to start using this feature again.

 WhatsApp read receipts are a two-way street. If you disable read receipts to prevent others from knowing you read their messages, you won't know when they read yours.

### WhatsApp Message Details

 If you're looking for specific information about the messages you've sent in WhatsApp, here's how to see those details:

1. Open a conversation.
2. Tap and hold the message, then select**Info** . Depending on your device, you might need to select the**three-dot** menu first.
3. If read receipts aren't disabled, you'll see the exact time your message was delivered and read.

## Messenger Read Receipts

 Like most texting apps,[Facebook Messenger](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-messenger-4103719) includes a handy toggle called**Show read receipts** . When it's turned on, you'll be able to see when people read your messages and they'll see when you've read theirs.

 Here's how to know when people read your Facebook messages; this works on Android and iOS:

1. Tap the**three-line** menu at the top of the app.
2. Select the**settings/gear** button at the top of the menu.
3. Scroll down and tap**Privacy & safety** .

![The Privacy and security screen and read receipts toggle in the Facebook Messenger app](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/bbHvAPlOyTbtWcVcsFhlUuuQUy4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/read-receipts-facebook-messenger-c45c63e4858e4a67b967003f10089270.png)

 The Facebook Messenger app provides detailed indicators about the delivery and read status each time you send a message. When your message is actively sending, you'll briefly see a blue circle. When it's sent, you'll see a blue circle with a checkmark. When it's delivered, you'll see a filled-in blue circle. Finally, when it's read, you'll see a small version of your recipient's profile image below the message.
