## Everything You Need to Know About Rich Communication Services (RCS)
 RCS stands for Rich Communication Services. It's a protocol that originated in 2008 as a potential replacement for[SMS messaging](https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-sms-text-messaging-578676) . This article provides a quick history along with its benefits over its predecessor, how you can use it, and its possible future.

## A Brief History of RCS

 Due in part to SMS’s reliability and availability (it works with every mobile phone on the market), RCS failed to become the new standard. However, the technology had something of a resurgence in 2016 when Google added an open-source RCS client to Android.

 Since then, RCS has continued to make inroads. In addition to powering[Google Messages](https://www.lifewire.com/use-android-messages-app-4177697) on Android devices, Apple has announced that it will[add RCS support to iOS](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23964171/apple-iphone-rcs-support) devices by the end of 2024, effectively replacing SMS.[iMessage](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-sms-mms-iphone-2000247) , which runs over Wi-Fi and cellular data networks, will continue to exist separately.

 With Apple on board, RCS will be supported by all major US carriers and now comes built-in on Samsung phones. Thanks to its integration with Google Messages, RCS is well-positioned to become the new standard for Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T.

## How RCS Messaging Works

 RCS is part of the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), a standardized architectural framework for delivering multimedia communications over IP networks. It's an upgrade to the outdated[Global System for Mobile Communications](https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-gsm-578670) (GSM) standard, which SMS uses.

 Due to the expense and complexity of implementing IMS architecture, it generally lost out to data-only standards like 3G, LTE, 5G, and the like. This relative simplicity is part of why SMS continues to be so pervasive despite being a decades-old technology.

 Unlike SMS, which runs over a voice-only cellular connection, RCS requires a mobile data connection. One of the main advantages of RCS is that its underlying technology allows for increased integration with smartphones. It therefore has functions like messages that open in other apps like browsers and maps, as well as increased multimedia support compared to SMS.

## How RCS Improves Mobile Messaging

 RCS messaging has several advantages compared to SMS and functions similarly to Apple’s iMessage. Along with supporting rich content like high-res images and video, RCS provides read/delivery receipts and typing indicators.

 There’s a common misconception that RCS offers improved security over SMS, but this isn’t necessarily true. Like SMS, RCS messages are unencrypted, leaving them open to interception. However, Google Messages offers end-to-end encryption, which effectively makes RCS an encrypted protocol.

 Encryption is on by default in Google Messages. To confirm it’s working, you should see a small lock symbol next to the Send button and a small padlock next to sent messages.

 The other main benefit of RCS is more theoretical at this stage. Since it provides many of the same benefits of dedicated apps like WhatsApp, Messenger, and even iMessage, it eliminates the need for such apps, many of which exist just to make up for the shortcomings of SMS.

 However, universal support is necessary to make a text-app-free device a reality. While RCS adoption has certainly grown in recent years, it’s unlikely we’ll see these apps diminish in popularity anytime soon.

## How Do I Use RCS?

 Similarly to SMS, you don’t need to download any specific app to start using RCS. The caveat is that your carrier needs to support it, and you need to use Google Messages.

 To ensure RCS messaging is turned on, open the**Messages** app, select your profile picture in the top-right corner, and select**Messages Settings** \>**RCS chats** .

 Assuming the above criteria is met, your regular text messages should be sent using RCS. If you’re unsure, check for read receipts and typing indicators, as these will signal that your phone is using RCS and not SMS.

 One important thing to take note of is that your recipient’s phone must also support RCS in order to receive RCS messages. If not, they’ll receive your messages as SMS.

## Will RCS Replace SMS?

 While RCS is well on its way to becoming the universal standard for smartphones, it’s unlikely to fully replace SMS.

 Since full RCS functionality requires a mobile data connection, it offers little benefit for older devices with voice-only cellular connections. Speaking of which, it’s unlikely that RCS will ever come to feature phones (“dumb phones”), which means these devices will still require SMS to exchange text messages.

 With its ubiquity on Android devices and iOS support on the way, RCS makes text messaging more functional and secure. It also avoids the walled-garden issue inherent to third-party messaging options, as you don’t need to worry about sending or receiving messages from within a dedicated app.

 In short, a better way to think of RCS is not as a full replacement for SMS but rather a way to paper over the latter’s shortcomings.
