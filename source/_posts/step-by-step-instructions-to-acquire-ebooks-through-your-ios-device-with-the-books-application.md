 Another way to read a book is to go to the Library. Every book you add to the Books app is stored thereâ€”including books you ordered from the Books app, transferred to your device from other apps, or copied to your iPad or iPhone.

 Once you're in the Library, select the book you want to read. It opens immediately. Swipe left and right to turn the pages or tap once to access the menu.
