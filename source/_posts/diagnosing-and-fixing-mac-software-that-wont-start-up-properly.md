[$299 at Nordstrom](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fstories-48mm-gradient-round-smart-glasses%2F6471564)

 Pros

* Classic Ray-Ban design
* Relatively simple to use

 Cons

* Requires a Facebook or Instagram account

 Developed with Meta (Facebook), Stories are unique in that they look like regular sunglasses. This is no surprise, given Ray-Ban created them, so they don't scream 'smart glasses' when you put them on, which is good.

 They are available in three different Ray-Ban styles—Meteor, Round, and Wayfarer, in five colors (glossy black, blue, brown, olive, or matte black) and six types of lenses (brown gradient, clear, dark blue, dark gray, green, or photochromatic green). Prescription lenses are also available, so it's fair to say Ray-Ban has most people covered.

 They double as Bluetooth headphones, and you use an app to upload videos and pictures taken with them. Unsurprisingly, you need a Facebook or Instagram account to do that.

 To take a picture, there's a capture button on the right arm, and a touch-sensitive surface gives you call, playback, and volume controls.

 Despite the privacy worries, these are the most fully featured smart glasses out there, and while there is no augmented reality display, Meta has talked about making one.

 Pros

* Bluetooth compatible
* Built-in earbuds
* Microphone for phone calls

 Cons

* No other smart features
* Inexpensive build

 Super high-tech features often come with a high price tag, so if you're looking for something more affordable, you should check out these futuristic-looking sunglasses from TechKen. They have built-in Bluetooth headphones extending down from the glasses' arms, making them an excellent option for exercising and other outdoor activities.

 While regular wireless earbuds can run the risk of falling out, these are attached directly to the sunglasses, so you can keep the music playing without fear of losing an expensive earbud.

 The adjustable headphones can be moved forward and back for a comfortable fit. They also have a built-in microphone to take calls when the glasses are connected to your phone. Button controls on the frame allow you to adjust the volume, play and pause music, and answer calls.

 Pros

* Attaches to your existing glasses
* Affordable
* Built-in playback controls

 Cons

* Bulky

 If you have prescription frames or a go-to pair of sunglasses you could never replace, the JLab Audio JBuds Frames attach to any glasses frames for instant wireless sound. They also include a microphone for phone calls. The open audio design plays music that only you can hear while leaving your ears open and uncovered—an excellent option for those who want to stay aware of their surroundings or who find traditional headphones uncomfortable to wear. Use both attachments for a more immersive audio experience, or switch to just one.

 The design is a little bulky, but the JBuds Frames make up for it with over eight hours of playback per charge. It also uses the latest Bluetooth 5.1 technology to pair to your smartphone with a stable, lag-free connection.

## What to Look For

 Smart glasses have quickly become one of the fastest-growing products in consumer tech. These futuristic-looking devices offer everything from augmented reality to hands-free calling, allowing you to enjoy many of the same features as smartphones without depending on screens. Whether for boosting productivity, digesting digital content /services, or any related activity, distinguish between dozens of smart glasses on the market by looking into their connectivity, display, controls, battery life, and comfort/durability.

**Connectivity**

 Almost all smart glasses support Bluetooth. Bluetooth connectivity allows them to be synced across all your favorite devices, including Windows, MacOS, iPhone, and Android. Some even work with other operating systems like Stream Deck, Nintendo Switch, and Asus ROG Ally. Be mindful of smartphone compatibility, as smart glasses mainly support newer versions (e.g., Android 8.1+ or iOS 13 or newer).

**Display & Controls**

 Choose smart glasses with adjustable focus and a clear, bright display. Other features include a high bridge fit for nose comfort, a lightweight design, and the highest resolution possible, consisting of OLED displays with 4K resolution and an expanded field of vision for better immersion with both pass-through and augmented reality experiences.

**Battery Life**

 At a minimum, look for smart glasses with up to four hours of continuous media playback at a respectable volume (e.g., 80%). Some, like Amazon’s Echo Frames, offer up to six hours of media playback. At the same time, charging times should last at most 75 minutes (from 0% to 100%) with an auxiliary cable or provided charging case.

**Comfort/Durability**

 To be as comfortable as possible, our recommended smart glasses come with adjustable frames, pads, and earpieces of various sizes. Look for a lightweight design and balanced weight distribution to wear them comfortably for extended periods. Bonus points for cushioned nose pads, hypoallergenic temple tips, ventilation channels to dissipate heat away from the eyes/face, and anti-glare coating to reduce eye strain.

**Extra Features**

 Today, smart glasses have plenty of extra features, such as the ability to adjust your outward-facing lens color, 12-megapixel cameras, and built-in voice assistants. Higher-priced smart glasses also do a better job of expanding your field of vision by as much as 200 inches, which is preferable for a movie or sports game.

 FAQ

* What are smart glasses used for?  
 Many smart glasses are fitted with cameras and microphones that allow for high-quality point-of-view video, which can be an invaluable training tool in many industries. Glasses with displays on the lenses allow digital information to overlay the real world, augmenting real-world activity with directions or other helpful information right before the wearer’s eyes.
* What is open-ear audio?  
 Open-ear audio technology delivers sound to your ears without blocking or covering them like traditional headphones. This can be achieved through strategically placed speakers that rest right next to the ear canal rather than in it, making the sound audible to you but not to the people next to you. Another method is to use bone conduction, which sends the audio vibrations directly to the inner ear through the bones in your skull.
* How much do smart glasses cost?  
 The price of smart glasses can vary widely. An essential pair of smart glasses that only provides Bluetooth audio shouldn't cost more than the standard pair of Bluetooth headphones or wireless earbuds.
