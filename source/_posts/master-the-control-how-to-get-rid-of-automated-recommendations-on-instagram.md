##  How to Delete Suggested Users From Instagram 

 Instagram tries to be helpful by connecting you with users you may want to follow based on factors like mutual friends and phone contacts. Here's how to remove a suggested profile if you're not interested in following the person:

1. In the Instagram app, scroll through your feed until you see a horizontal list of suggested users labeled**Suggestions for you** . It will likely appear close to the top of your feed, after the first or second most recent post.
2. Select the**X** in the top right corner of any suggested user box. The suggestion will disappear immediately.  
 Instagram will not ask you to confirm that you want to delete the suggestion, so be sure you really don't want to be reminded to follow them. You can't undo this, although you can still search for the person later since this is not the same as[ blocking the profile](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-block-someone-on-instagram-4169853) .
3. Alternatively, to speed up the deletion process, select**See all** above the list of suggested users. Here, you can remove several suggestions in quick succession.

##  How to Stop Instagram From Suggesting Your Account to Others 

 Your profile might be in this same 'Suggestions for you' section on other people's Instagram accounts. While[ making your account private](https://www.lifewire.com/make-instagram-account-private-3485850) won't hide your profile from being suggested to others, there is a toggle you can turn off in your profile settings that will put an end to this.

This only works from the website, not the app.

1. Open your profile on the Instagram website by selecting your**profile icon** in the top right corner.
