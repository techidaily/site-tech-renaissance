## Why Does My TV Look Blue?

 Your TV's settings are the most common reason your TV might look blue. Most TVs have various image quality adjustments that can alter the image's appearance. While most settings make the TV look better, a mistake can cause unwanted results, including an overly blue appearance.

 It's not the only reason a TV may look blue. Other causes include:

* An incorrect setting on an attached device.
* Faulty cables or connections.
* A defective backlight on an LCD television with an LED backlight.

 A blue tint does not always mean there's a problem. Some TVs have a slight blue tint when operating normally.

## How to Fix a TV That Looks Blue

 Follow these steps to fix a TV that looks blue. These steps should resolve the problem caused by incorrect settings on your television, incorrect settings on a device, or a faulty connection.

1. Turn the TV off and back on again. Doing this rarely helps but only takes a second and has a slight chance of resolving the problem.
2. Press the**Menu** button on your television's remote. A list of settings should appear on the television. Look for a section labeled**Image Mode** ,**Picture Mode** , or**Display Mode** .  
 This section will include preset modes with labels such as**Cinematic** or**Bright** . Flip through these modes to see if the resulting image is more to your liking.
3. Press the Menu button on your television's remote. Look for a section labeled**Color Temperature** . It will list presets with labels such as**Warm** and**Cool** . Change the color temperature setting to**Warm** .  
 Some TVs will instead list[color temperature](https://www.lifewire.com/tv-color-temperature-4156944) in degrees Kelvin, such as**6500K** or**5700K** . Adjust the TV to a setting below**5000K** .
4. Try changing the color temperature on the device sending the video to your television. The steps for this will vary depending on the device, but many offer image, video, or picture settings that can impact image quality.  
 Consult the device's manual for more information on the settings it provides.
5. Check the connection of the device sending video to the television. Make sure the video cable, usually an HDMI cable, is firmly connected to the TV.

6. Check the HDMI cable connecting the device you're using to your TV. Look for signs of wear, including cuts, tears, exposed wiring, or knots. Replace the cable if you notice any damage.
7. Remove the HDMI cable from the television. Check the end of the HDMI cable's connector and the TV's HDMI port for signs of damage. Replace the cable if the connector appears damaged. If your TV's HDMI port seems to be damaged, try using a different port.
8. Try connecting a different device to your TV through a different HDMI port. It will help you determine if the problem is with your TV or the device connected to it.

## How Do You Fix a Blue Screen on an LED TV?

 Does your LED TV still look blue? There are two possible reasons.

* The TV is working correctly but has an inherent blue tint.
* The TV has a defective LED backlight.

 Most flat-panel LCD TVs have an LED backlight. An LED backlight is bright, slim, and efficient, but LED lighting often has a cool color temperature, which casts a slight blue tint. This quality is most noticeable when viewing a white image and much less noticeable when viewing other colors. It should significantly change when you change your TV's color temperature, though this may not eliminate the blue tint.

 However, if the problem is more serious, the LED backlight might be defective. It's likely true if the blue tint bleeds into all colors shown on the television, especially if it's visible in dark gray or even black portions of an image. A defective backlight will appear blue no matter the color temperature you select on the TV.

 You can manage a TV with an inherent blue tint by changing the color temperature to the warmest setting available. You can only fix a defective backlight by contacting the TV manufacturer for a warranty repair or taking the TV to a local repair shop.

## How Do You Fix a Blue Screen on an OLED TV?

 Despite similar names, LED and[OLED](https://www.lifewire.com/oled-tv-basics-1846926) TVs use fundamentally different technology. The blue tint issues that can occur because of defective LED backlighting are not present on OLED TVs.

 That doesn't mean OLED is immune to blue tint. A defective OLED panel might cause a permanent blue tint, but this should be obvious when taking the TV out of the box.
