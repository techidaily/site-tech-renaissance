## Is There a Google Hangouts Replacement?

 Google has other similar services like[Google Chat](https://chat.google.com/) and Google Voice. Both are free and share lots of the same features as Google Hangouts. You can make free calls to any phone with Voice and text with other Google users with Chat. There's also[Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) for one-on-one or group meetings.

 If you want to move away from Google's options, countless apps serve as a great Google Hangouts alternative.[Facebook Messenger](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-messenger-4103719) and[Snapchat](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-snapchat-3485908) are well-known messaging and calling apps, but there are plenty of other options.

 FAQ

* Is Google Hangouts still available online?  
 Yes, but group calls and many other features have been removed. For video conferencing, use[Google Meet or Zoom](https://www.lifewire.com/see-what-sets-these-video-conferencing-apps-apart-5077639) .
* Are Google Hangout conversations private?  
 Yes, but Google maintains records of online text conversations in compliance with federal law.
