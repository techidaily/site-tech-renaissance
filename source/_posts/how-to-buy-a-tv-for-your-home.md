## General Instructions for Finding Your Email Address

 The easiest way to identify your email address in almost any desktop program or online email client is to start writing a new message. Here's how:

1. Start a new email message. This usually works by selecting a Compose, New, or Write button.

2. Look for a line that begins with**From** . It contains your email address.  
![From field in Thunderbird on macOS](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/U286s-oO_Fk2Ih1u8Rl4JwZ94nQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002_what-is-my-email-address-5ac0b8ce371249c3a9b9c65b9aa9a778.jpg)
3. If you have more than one email address configured for sending, they usually show up as menu choices in the**From** line when you compose an email. All the email addresses listed are yours. You can use any of them.

 Need to find your old email address? Some[people finder tools](https://www.lifewire.com/search-engines-that-top-the-web-3482269) can dig up that information.

## Use an Echo Service to See Your Email Address

 An echo service is another way to see what email address you're using. This method is typically used to[test whether your email is working properly](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-test-your-email-address-1171119) , but as an added bonus, part of the response you receive includes your email address. Here's how this works:

1. Compose a new email and enter**<echo@univie.ac.at>** in the**To** field. No subject line or message is necessary.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1047974&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-04_%281%29.jpg" border="0"></a>

2. Select**Send** .
3. Wait for the automated response. The recipient line says**Echo** and the subject line says**Automatic Response from <echo@univie.ac.at>** .
4. Open the email and scroll down a bit until you see the**Received** section. In there is a line like this that shows your email address:  
 `(envelope-from <youremail@example.com>)`
