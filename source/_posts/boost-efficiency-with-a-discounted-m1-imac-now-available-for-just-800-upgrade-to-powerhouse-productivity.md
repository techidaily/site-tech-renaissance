## Boost Efficiency with a Discounted M1 iMac Now Available for Just $800 – Upgrade to Powerhouse Productivity

The M1 iMac might have released in 2021, but this all-in-one computer is still a powerhouse, and Best Buy has them on sale.

 Have you been eyeing an iMac? Don't count the M1 version out! Currently, at Best Buy, you can [24-inch, 8-core Apple M1 iMac](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fimac-24-with-retina-4-5k-display-all-in-one-apple-m1-8gb-memory-256gb-ssd-pink%2F6450918.p%3FskuId%3D6450918) for just $899.99, a big $550 off the asking price. The 7-core Apple M1 iMac is also on sale for $849.99, but unless you're really strapped for cash, paying the extra $50 is worth it.

 Now, these are iMac models from 2021, and [iMacs with the M3 chip](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2023-iMac-Desktop-Computer/dp/B0CM5J9P3Y?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002776&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fimac-best-buy-sale%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) released last year, so you may wonder why you'd want to go for an older model. Apple products have a longer shelf life than you may expect, and even today the [M1 chip](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/expert-guide-finding-and-installing-the-right-drivers-for-your-hp-thunderbolt-g2-dock-whether-you-need-120w-or-230w-power-support/) is still a powerhouse for most productivity tasks. It's why we still [recommend the M1 MacBook Air in 2024](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-advice-on-reversing-non-functional-obs-fullscreen/)!

 So, unless you're looking to do some heavy processing or high-end gaming, the M1 iMac is a fantastic purchase. The $900 price tag is a great value compared to many PCs as well, where towers can cost more, and it doesn't include a monitor. With the iMac, you get everything you need right out of the box, and all of the hardware is built into the monitor itself. And finally, it just looks fantastic—iMacs make for a color, yet sleek and clean looking workstation. It just can't get much better than this.

 It's hard to tell how long Best Buy will hold this particular sale, but it's best not to wait too long. If dropping $900 in one day isn't possible, you can sign up for a 12-month financing plan, so you can pay $75/month if you qualify.
