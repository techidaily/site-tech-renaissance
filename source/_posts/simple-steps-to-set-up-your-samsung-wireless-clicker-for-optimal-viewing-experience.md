## Apple TV 4K (3rd generation)

Apple

 Pros

* Same much-improved Siri remote as the previous version
* A broad selection of apps, including Apple Fitness+
* Remote uses USB-C

 Cons

* Pricier than competing devices like Roku and Fire Stick
* Navigation can be tedious

 The 3rd-gen Apple TV 4K is smaller, lighter, and faster than the 2nd-gen model and well worth the upgrade if you have a non-4K Apple TV.

 The 3rd generation of the Apple TV 4K is an incremental improvement over its predecessor and offers a few welcome changes, including a USB-C port in the Siri remote. (This model came out in 2022 before the USB-C iPhone 15 series arrived.) Sharing cables between devices and people keeps getting easier. As of late 2023, this is Apple's most recent Apple TV model, and it lives up to expectations.

## What’s New: A faster processor and a USB-C remote

 The 3rd-generation Apple TV 4K sports the company's A15 chip (the previous version had the A12), so there's a definite bump in speed. The unit is smaller and lighter than the earlier version. The[Siri remote](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNC73AM/A/siri-remote?fnode=258edd37bcbf2e59b54e4550bd47400b8141f5ead7d8e35942c4c4fc0665243cad510ef9986ee74b4ba4c40c28f229c3c01f602f14ed6c8c4d38856b532ec76858b83df2cb6d50f38de7f589e180ddbf2812fc6f12854c98c1ae402b8d9d1e35) is nearly the same, except for its USB-C port.

Apple

 Its price dropped by $50, from $179 to $129\. Like previous Apple TVs, this model runs on[tvOS](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tvos-4690282) , which is regularly updated.

## Setup: Nearly automatic if you have an iPhone handy

 If you have an iPhone, the setup is simple. Plug the Apple TV 4K in, connect it to your TV, select the appropriate input, and follow the prompts on your phone. It took us only a few minutes to get up and running.

 You can play around with color balance and other settings from your phone, and then you need to download and sign into your apps.

## Performance: Silky smooth

 As expected, it's responsive, and the interface is better than the smart TVs I've used.

 However, the remote can be a bit jumpy, and navigation can be tedious sometimes - switching between apps takes more than a few presses of the Back button.

 In my experience, remote controls tend to have too many buttons. In Apple's case, it has too few.

 It would be nice if there were a Home button. The TV button goes straight to the Apple TV app rather than the home screen. It does have a dedicated mute button, though.

## Who Should Buy This?

 There's no real need to upgrade if you have a second generation that's still going. Anything older, then do. If you don't own an Apple TV but use Fitness+ quite a bit, it's a good investment. (We use it for at-home yoga. It also has games, recipe apps, and more.
