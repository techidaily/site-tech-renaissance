**Motion Picture Rating** : NR

**Running Time** : 1 hour, 36 minutes

 2023's_Godzilla Minus One_ reignited some interest in the older Japanese films about the radioactive monster. You can't do much better than the 1954 original, which is not only beautifully shot and conceived but it also surprisingly scary.

 Forget every silly gif you've ever seen of Godzilla doing a dance or dropkicking a monster from several miles away._Godzilla_ shows the King of Monsters at his most terrifying. The stark, black-and-white photography and impressive creature design will make you forget you're looking at a person in a suit.
