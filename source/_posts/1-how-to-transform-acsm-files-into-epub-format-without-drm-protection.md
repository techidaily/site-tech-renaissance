We often get an [.ACSM file](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) after purchasing an eBook online, but it's not the eBook file. Here I will tell you how to convert ACSM to EPUB and PDF, then strip eBook DRM for reading on various devices.

To convert ACSM to EPUB you just need to follow these simple steps:

1. Install Adobe Digital Editions (ADE)
2. Authorize with your Adobe ID
3. Open the .ACSM file via ADE
4. ADE would save the .acsm to .epub (or .pdf)
5. Use EPUB DRM Removal to remove DRM from the EPUB

Below is the step-by-step guide.

![acsm to epub xmind](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/acsm2epub-xmind.png)

### How to Convert ACSM to EPUB books

Step 1 [Download Adobe Digital Editions 4.5 (ADE)](http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions/download.html). 

Step 2 Register an Adobe Account and authorize ADE with your Adobe Account by clicking "Help"->"Authorize computer".

![authorize Adobe ID](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/authorize-adobe-id.png)

Have installed ADE before and wanted to switch to another account? 

please press "Ctrl + Shift + D" (Mac users press "Command + Shift + D") to wipe out the formal authorization information and re-authorize with the correct Adobe ID.

Step 3  Open .ACSM with authorized Adobe Digital Editions to download eBooks.

Double click the .ACSM format file you downloaded from the online library, then it will be opened with Adobe Digital Editions as default and start downloading.

![open acsm epub](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/open-acsm-ade.png)

**Tips:** If your .ACSM file is not opened by ADE as default, right click the file and select "_Open with_" -> "_Adobe Digital Editions 4.5_ ".

![convert ACSM to EPUB - open](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-acsm-to-epub-open.png)

**Output path of your EPUB file** is:

**For Windows:** _...\\My Documents (Documents)\\My Digital Editions ..._

**For Mac**: _Users/Your computer name/Digital Editions ..._

You can also switch to _"File"_ Menu -> _"Item Info"_ \-> _"Location"_ to check the location of your downloaded EPUB book.

![convert ACSM to EPUB - output path](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/acsm-location.png)

After downloading the eBook, you can delete the .ACSM or back it up for downloading the eBook later.

We can read the converted EPUB eBooks on Adobe supported devices like Sony eReader, Kobo reader, Android Devices (with reading apps like BlueFire installed) etc. Just copy the converted EPUB files to the specified eBook folder of your device with the USB cable connected to your computer. Make sure **your eReader is authorized with the same Adobe account**, otherwise you will be prohibited to open the EPUB books.

However, you can't directly read the books on Apple Devices (iPad, iPod, iPhone with iBooks) and Amazon Kindle titles because they don't support Adobe DRMed books unless you can install compatible ADE app. So we have to remove DRM from the eBooks, then transfer them to anywhere as you like. Here is [the best software for removing DRM from Adobe DRM protected ePUB](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/).

I have read this information before with Adobe digital. Perhaps Adobe Digital is not installed corrctly.  
 I did not see a software to remove DRM. You mentioned being the best software but did not give the name.

Does Epubor only allow you to access a portion of a book when you use the free trial version? I tried it with a book that has 248 pages and only the first 50 pages converted.

Thanks for this guide. However, I tried getting an ID but never received an email confirmation from Adobe. So in the end I tried 'activate without an ID' and it worked fine. So maybe you don't need to bother?

 I also didn't bother with DRM for the two books I converted. They seem to work fine.

 Thanks again.

Your instructions are easy to understand and I have followed them. My problem is adding the ebooks to Calibre. I cannot open them there and I also am unable to download from ADE to my Sony reader. I am not computer literate so many things are not as simple as they seem. I read that I should be able to download to my reader from ADE but I see nothing to tell me that I can.

Hi Clemira,  
 We are very sorry for the late reply.   
 Calibre is not able to add your books because your books are DRM protected, Calibre is only able to handle those DRM-free eBooks. 

 Now have you get the .ePub files or still .acsm files?

"the program will find your EPUB files automatically."

 I bought a Google E-book (acsm file) and opened it in ADE, but apparently the file hasn't turned into an EPUB file; instead, it appears as a .pdf file instead. I tried putting ".epub" at the end of the file name, but the program failed in removing the DRM. 

 How do I solve this???

Hi Louise,

 Yes sometimes the .acsm will give a PDF file.

 Then you need to use our Adobe EPUB&PDF DRM Removal, it can handle both EPUB and PDF files.

Adobe Digital Editions fails to download epub content from acsm, just says about some license error and server error with something about unknown filetype.

 Authorization is ok, tried that to some sample book (acsm) from ade website.

 this drm is frustrating, you can't read the book you just bought.. :/

Did that, contacted to google, and thay said it is font which is causing problems and they are trying to solve problem. No timefrime tough. They also offered option to get refund from book.

 This shows that drm is crap, if you cand download book with some font by using acsm file, but you could do it other way just fine. Sure there are lot more reasons why drm is crap, but...

 The Kindle DRM Removal only supports Kindle formats, but you are trying to remove DRM from EPUB with it, so it says "Don't support the format"

1\. Ctrl + Shift + D, erase authorization.

 2\. Delete your files under "My Digital Editions".

 3\. Download the old version of ADE, log in with your Adobe ID(authorize).

 4\. Download your ACSM file again and drag it to the ADE.

Here I was using Adobe Digital Edition to download some ACSM books from Google Book Store, and it corrupted with error message as " E\_GOOGLE\_DEVICE\_LIMIT\_REACHED", so does it be pohabited by Google?

The DRM removal seemed to work just fine, but the de-DRM pdf I got has the following tezt 

 "Your ebook has decrypted.  
 The TXT file just save 20% of ebook content.  
 Please register the software, then get full content and the valid ebook  
 format."

 Only a fifth of the book is actually there. Is there any way to get around this?

That's because you are using the trail version. If you want to get the whole content of the decrypted book, you need to purchase the license version.

It somewhat worked, what you trade for getting rid of the DRM, you get ugly xhtml text formatting or no formatting, and it only converted 1/3rd of the book, rather disappointing.

You are using the trial version. It will decrypt and convert 20% content of each book.  
 Here is the solution:  
 Solution 1: Buy the full version.

 Solution 2: Ask for customer support team to ask for temporary license.

 Solution 3: Contact editor team to help translation the software or one article in exchange of a free license .

ADE has my login and account correctly set up and I've successfully converted previous ACSM files. With this book I get an error message: AdeptDRM failed!

 To test, I again successfully converted a previous book from last week so it's only this book, Any suggestions you have would be appreciated.

It does the work. And I thought USD 30 is okay. However, a little expensive for just removing the DRM. USD 20 is a more 'normal' price for a removal tool. But then, and I'm getting really annoyed by these practices, it is only for a 1-year subscription. If you want a lifetime subscription, it costs USD 55\. For a removal tool. Are you serious?

I purchased epubor ultimate and was able to successfully convert 31 purchased kindle books to epubs for my archive. For the most part your sw worked well and I'm satisfied. However, I have encountered ADE issues with books downloaded from my library. I have installed ADE 4.5.11 on my Win7Pro pc with sp1\. If I download several epub books from my library and try to import the .acsm files to ADE (about half the time) I get an error that it can not open the .acsm file in my c:\\users\\...\\downloads folder. I've tried uninstalling ADE, removing and reauthorizing, upgrading my NETF to 4.8, deleting the C:\\Users\\...\\Documents\\My Digital Editions folder and using a different pc setup. Still 2 or 3 out of 5 books fail. I then cleaned up ADE 4.5.11 and installed an old version of ADE 3.0 + authorization and I can download/import 5/5 books successfully. I've tried ADE 4.5.11 on win10pro and it works fine. I can not figure out what's wrong and my epubor ultimate won't accept a .acsm file.  
 I know I can just leave ADE on 3.0 and forget it but would still like to know what is causing the error.
