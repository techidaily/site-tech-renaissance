## 2024’S Top 26 Freeware Registry Sanitizers: The Definitive Rankings for a Streamlined PC

Close 

 Based on my experience using each of these registry cleaner programs, I've ranked the better choices toward the top of the list. Most of the others are[ abandonware](https://www.lifewire.com/abandonware-definition-4154657) and aren't improved on anymore, but they do still work!

[ Registry Cleaners FAQ ](https://www.lifewire.com/registry-cleaner-faq-2625124) 

 This list includes only freeware—in other words, only_completely_ free registry cleaners. Any registry cleaner program that charges a fee of any kind (e.g., shareware, trialware) isn't included here. If one of these programs has started to charge, and we haven't removed it yet, please[ let us know](https://www.lifewire.com/mailto:feedback@lifewire.com) .

## [ CCleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/ccleaner-review-2625143) 

![list of registry issues in ccleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SABhAygRUmRlfj9olEUIb11AuT4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ccleaner-registry-scan-2317411376b442e1ad36193523675803.png) 

 What We Like

* Creates a backup file before making any changes to the registry.
* Contains outstanding feature set.
* Offers installable and portable versions.

 What We Don't Like

* Installer adds another program unless expressly denied permission.
* Could use expanded documentation for new users.
* Free only for home users.

[ CCleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/ccleaner-review-2625143) is the best free registry cleaner program I've tested. It's easy to use, prompts you to back up the registry before it makes changes, and includes a number of other useful tools.

 Piriform provides both installable and portable versions of their free registry cleaner.

 If you're set on using an automated tool to fix an issue you have that's caused by a registry problem, I highly recommend you use Piriform's CCleaner freeware registry cleaner tool.

 I tested the latest version, CCleaner v6, in Windows 11 using both their portable and installable versions. It can also clean the registry in Windows 10, 8, and 7.

## [ Auslogics Registry Cleaner](https://www.auslogics.com/en/software/registry-cleaner/) 

![Auslogics Registry Cleaner 10](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/EQtZmBxS-M1cmQnFHGwStPqvPNY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/auslogics-registry-cleaner-10-1ab49642535542df8c4f2ab629a2e8f8.png) 

 What We Like

* One-click cleaning.
* Automatic registry backup.
* Can be paused and then continue later.
* Nicely formatted report of problems found and fixed.
* Lets you create a portable version.

 What We Don't Like

* Tries to install additional programs during setup.
* Several extra features aren't free.

 Auslogics Registry Cleaner is probably one of the easiest registry cleaners to use out of all the tools I've tested.

 One nice feature is the extremely detailed reports page. After any cleaning, you can open a document that shows, in detail, everything that the program fixed.

 In the settings, you can access Rescue Center, which is a list of registry backups made before each cleaning. You can edit the settings to keep the backups forever if you never want to lose them. This is a fantastic feature not found in all registry fixers, so I was happy to see it included here.

 It's compatible with modern versions of Windows like Windows 11 and Windows 10, plus Windows 8 and Windows 7.

 Auslogics Registry Cleaner was updated to v10 when I tested it.

[ Download Auslogics Registry Cleaner ](https://www.auslogics.com/en/software/registry-cleaner/) 

 Before and after installing Auslogics Registry Cleaner, you may be asked to install other programs, but they're easy to deselect it if you wish not to install it.

## [ Wise Registry Cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/wise-registry-cleaner-review-2625142) 

![Wise Registry Cleaner v11](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Nq7JxpJAtyPjEOHjoFUwGcmIM9k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/wise-registry-cleaner-11-9944ae38822b49ce922e0b658cb78049.png) 

 What We Like

* Easy to use.
* Automatically backs up registry before cleaning.

 What We Don't Like

* Some features appear free, but require payment.

 Wise Registry Cleaner comes in very close to the other top-rated registry fix tools. They've put together a fantastic free registry cleaner program.

[ Some big pluses for Wise's free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/wise-registry-cleaner-review-2625142) include fast registry scans, in-place updates, and a clear separation between normal issues and those that are "unsafe," a feature I loved.

 It comes in both installable and portable versions and can be used on Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP (only the portable version works on XP).

 I tested the installable edition of v11 in Windows 11.

## [ JetClean](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/System-Tweak/JetClean.shtml) 

![JetClean v1.5.0 in Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Aj6ZeRGM9-_X_ThESOXwNb6NOro=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/jetclean-1-5-0-58c6ae225f9b58af5c2f7ed8.png) 

 What We Like

* Clean, intuitive interface.
* Automatically backs up registry.
* Scheduled cleanings.
* One-click scan.

 What We Don't Like

* Tries to install toolbar during installation.
* Portable version generated within installed version.
* Keeps a lot of cookies.

 JetClean, a free registry cleaner by BlueSprig, isn't one I see mentioned a lot, but I found it to be very well done. It scanned the entire registry in just a few seconds and has a well-designed interface.

 There are two major things I don't like about JetClean. One: The number of cookies that it considers keepable, by default, is a bit excessive. Two: It tries to install a toolbar, but you can decline it during installation.

 I also don't like that there's not an easily available portable version of the program. Yes, one exists, but you have to "generate" one from within the installed version on your computer. Strange!

 The JetClean registry cleaner supports both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows 2000.

 I tested v1.5.0 in Windows 10 and Windows 7\. This is probably its final version; it hasn't been updated in ages.

## [ Advanced SystemCare Free](https://www.iobit.com/en/advancedsystemcarefree.php) 

![Advanced SystemCare Free 15 manual clean mode options](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2oB1Jdbmb4-xL0eQ8-cvXN4GnXc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/advanced-systemcare-15-manual-mode-758cc654383246b08a016ca27aa9cbe0.png) 

 What We Like

* One-click scan and repair mode.
* No need to view the scan results before repairing the registry.
* Good for users who aren't tech-savvy.

 What We Don't Like

* Must uncheck all other options before scanning the registry.
* All the features can be overwhelming.

 Advanced SystemCare Free is one of IObit’s many freeware programs._Registry Clean_ is the utility within it that does the registry cleaning.

 Right off the bat, you'll notice, like I did, how much you can do in this program. There are checkboxes you can enable to do all sorts of stuff in addition to clean the registry, like defrag the registry, run a privacy sweep, and delete junk files.

 I have found the registry scan to be very quick, regardless of the number of errors the program found. ASC is great for the non-tech-savvy because you don’t even have to view the results to repair them. Moreover, you could actually shut down or restart your PC when the cleaning is finished, so you don’t have to worry about it.

 One thing I don’t like is that if you’re after a particular cleaning type, like registry cleaning, you must first uncheck all the other options. All the features that are offered can be overwhelming and get in your way.

 To run the registry cleaning process, choose**Manual Mode** from the**Care** tab. Choose**Select All** a couple of times to clear out all the checkboxes, and then choose**Registry Clean** followed by**SCAN** .

 The_Deep Clean_ option requires the professional version of the program.

 ASC works in Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. I tested v16 in Windows 11.

 What We Like

* Creates backup automatically.
* Uncluttered interface.
* Program updates automatically.

 What We Don't Like

* No option to create a restore point.
* May try to install unneeded programs during setup.

 Glarysoft's Registry Repair is another good freeware registry cleaner. It's pretty simple to use and is a good option if some of the better tools aren't working out for you.

 I appreciate that backups are made automatically because you never know when you might need one. Unfortunately, unlike some of these similar tools, Glarysoft's program won't make a restore point for you, although you could always[ make a restore point yourself](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) .

 Registry Repair was designed for Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, and some older versions of Windows.

 I tested v5.0.1 in Windows 10 and Windows 7.

## [ Kingsoft PC Doctor](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/kingsoft%5Fpc%5Fdoctor.html)

 What We Like

* Automatic registry backup.
* Uncluttered interface.
* Includes additional useful tools.

 What We Don't Like

* Hasn't been updated in years.
* No scheduling options.
* Can't fix all identified problems, which reappear on subsequent scans.

 Kingsoft PC Doctor is another registry cleaner embedded in a software suite. It's really easy to use, and the registry cleaner isn’t hidden away deep inside — it’s very easy to spot and run without any hassles.

 One thing I don't like about this choice is that you can’t schedule a registry cleaning at a later date, but you must instead run it manually. While this is the case, the manual scans do find a hefty amount of errors that are just a click away from being removed.

 It's said to work only with Windows 7, Vista, and XP, but I tested v3.7 in Windows 10 and Windows 8 without any issues. This is probably the final version of this software, considering it hasn't been updated anytime recently.

 What We Like

* Interface isn't confusing.
* Generates automatic registry backups.
* Highly customizable.

 What We Don't Like

* Interface shows its age.
* Lots of options increase the chance of causing problems.
* Not as user-friendly as other registry cleaners.

 PowerTools Lite is a freeware registry cleaner created by Macecraft, makers of several popular Windows utilities. When I used it last, PowerTools Lite was fast and found a similar number of needless registry entries as other tools in this area of this list.

 No toolbars or other programs tried to install like with some other free registry cleaners.

 It works with Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. However, the tool isn't supported above Windows 7.

 What We Like

* User-friendly interface.
* Scans for invalid or obsolete information.
* Automatic registry backup.
* No adware.

 What We Don't Like

* Insufficient descriptions of registry problems.
* May require using RegEdit after scan.

 I frequently see references to Eusing Free Registry Cleaner on other "top" lists, but I didn't find anything spectacular about it other than the_huge_ list of problems it identified. It's unclear to me how accurate the program is, but it's worth a shot if you didn't get what you needed from the other tools listed above.

 Remember, a registry cleaner program is not a regular PC maintenance tool. Registry cleaners don't typically speed up your computer or provide any other day-to-day improvements to your PC. Registry cleaners should only be used to help solve specific kinds of problems.

 Eusing Software says the program works on Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP. I tested v4.6 in Windows 10.

 What We Like

* Choice of two analysis modes.
* Easy to undo changes to registry.
* Backs up registry automatically.

 What We Don't Like

* Interface learning curve.
* No scheduled scans.

 Argente Registry Cleaner is a registry cleaner that walks you through a tiny wizard when you first open the program, which makes scanning for errors rather easy. It found about as many issues as the other programs in this list.

 Registry backups are created automatically before removing any registry items, and an automatic maintenance mode does all the cleaning for you when your computer first starts, without any intervention on your part, which is really nice.

 Undoing changes to your registry is easy because you can either restore to an automatically created backup or make your own registry backup whenever you like, and then restore the registry from the _Undo changes_ section of the program.

 Argente Registry Cleaner works in Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. I tested v3.1 on Windows 10 and Windows 7.

* Includes other useful tools.
* Plenty of settings options.

 What We Don't Like

* Doesn't work with more recent versions of Windows.
* Hasn't been updated in years.

 EasyCleaner is one of the oldest free registry cleaners out there. The interface is a bit dated, but it's a solid registry repair tool... assuming you don't need to use it on a modern computer!

 It took considerably longer than other registry cleaners to scan the registry, but it did a fine job overall. I also liked that I wasn't asked to install some other completely unrelated and useless program during the installation.  

 The ToniArts website says that the software works in Windows XP, 2000, NT, ME, 98, and 95, but you might have luck using it in newer versions of Windows, too.

 I tested v2.0.6 in Windows 8 without any problems, but it didn't work correctly for me in Windows 10\. Both installer and portable versions of this tool are available.

 What We Like

* Automatic registry backup.
* Portable version.
* Open source, multi-language software.

 What We Don't Like

* Ad supported.
* Little guidance.
* Slower than some other programs in this field.
* Development appears to have ended.

 This free Windows Registry cleaner program packs some great features into a minimal program. 

 For starters, Little Registry Cleaner found a lot more problems in the registry than most other registry cleaners I've used, so if one of the others in this list isn't working well for you, try this one.

 This program also lets you choose which folder on your computer to use for automatic registry backups before cleaning, can ignore certain files and folders from being scanned, will create a restore point before deleting the registry files, and can scan your computer for invalid registry entries on a schedule.

 Little Registry Cleaner should work fine with any recent version of Windows, plus older ones like Windows XP. I tested version 1.6.0 in Windows 10 and didn't run into any problems.

 What We Like

* Options for full and custom scans.
* Creates restore points.
* Option to back up registry.
* Can be set to scan registry at system startup automatically.

 What We Don't Like

* Insufficient guidance on how to use the program.
* Requires multiple scans to identify all errors.

 Free Window Registry Repair reminds me a lot of Eusing Free Registry Cleaner, listed above, so my assessment is similar. Try this registry cleaner if you_need_ to, skip it and try a better one if you don't.

 Registry scan time with Free Window Registry Repair was longer than with some of the higher rated registry cleaners, but overall it looks like a decent tool.

 RegSofts Software's website says it is compatible with Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, Vista, XP, and 2000, NT, ME and 98\. There's an installable and a portable version available.

 I successfully used Free Window Registry Repair to clean up the registry in both Windows 10 and Windows 7.

 What We Like

* Attractive, easy-to-use interface.
* Scan generates list of obsolete and invalid files.

 What We Don't Like

* Asks permission to install unrelated program.
* Annoying prompts to upgrade to paid version.
* Documentation in German.

 Secure Eraser is a program suite that includes a dedicated section for registry cleaning as well as for other tools like a file shredder.

 The registry cleaning function seemed to find most of the same errors and invalid entries as the other cleaners in this list.

 After cleaning the registry, a results page will display in your browser. This can be annoying, but it's easily toggled off from the settings.

 It works with Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP. When I tested it, setup tried to add another program to my computer, so watch out for that, and skip/decline any offers if you don't want them.

 What We Like

* Easy to use.
* Complete toolset.
* Aggressive cleaner best for experienced users.

 What We Don't Like

* Hasn't been upgraded in years.
* New users could end up deleting items the computer needs.
* Confusing interface.

 nCleaner seems to be as good a registry cleaner as any other in this area of this list. It does all your standard registry cleaning, as well as some system cleaning.

 I found nCleaner's interface to be a little confusing, and I don't like that it hasn't been updated in years (like most of the tools this low in the list). However, I felt compelled to at least include it here after receiving so many suggestions to add it to the list.

 v2.3.4 is the one I tested. It seemed to work well for me in Windows 10 and Windows 8, but it's only listed as supporting up to Windows Vista.

* Clean user interface.
* Registry wizard.
* Backs up before scanning.
* Defrags the registry.

 What We Don't Like

* Offers to install promotional and third-party software.
* Contains advertisements.

 If the other options above look too confusing, you might like this pick because of its easy-to-use wizard for cleaning the registry.

 With Registry Life, you can not only fix registry issues, but also defrag the registry and even have quick access to an additional free tool to stop or delay programs from starting up with your computer.

 One thing I didn't like during my tests was that there were occasional advertisements off to the side of the program.

 Registry Life should work with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 8 down through Windows XP. It worked for me in Windows 10, but the startup optimizer didn't always function as advertised.

 What We Don't Like

* Interface looks outdated.
* Contains unrelated tools that new users may find confusing.

 ACleaner is another free registry cleaner with a bit of an outdated UI, but it works for the newer operating systems and does the job well.

 I like this program because the Windows registry is backed up automatically before fixing any issues, and restoring is just a couple clicks away. There's also a startup manager and system cleaner that comes bundled with ACleaner, but the registry cleaner isn't difficult to find.

 It works with Windows 11 down through Windows 2000\. I tested v5 in both Windows 10 and Windows 7 and didn't find any problems.

 PCSleek Error Cleaner is a registry cleaner with an easy-to-use interface. It combines a few other search parameters in addition to the registry, but they’re very easy to disable if you just want to fix registry issues.

 Although the program looks outdated and simple, it backs up the registry before cleaning and seems to find about as many problems as the other registry cleaners in this list.

 PCSleek is said to work in Windows 7, Vista, and XP. I tested v3.46 in Windows 8 without any issues.

 What We Like

* Clean interface.
* Defrags the registry in addition to scanning for errors.
* Available in installed and portable versions
* Option to schedule daily or weekly registry check.

 What We Don't Like

* Sometimes requires multiple scans to find all errors.
* Some virus scanners call it "unwanted" or "deceptive" software.

 Registry Recycler is another free registry cleaner that seems to find more errors than some of the other programs in this list. I've included it because I appreciate the ability to run registry error checks on a schedule.

 The program automatically creates registry backups before cleaning to ensure you can always return to a working state if anything goes wrong during the process. In addition to cleaning, Registry Recycler can also defrag the registry.

 You can use this free registry cleaner tool as a portable program or install it like normal software, depending on the version you pick on the download page.

 Registry Recycler works with Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP.

* Fast scan quickly locates errors.
* Backs up registry automatically.
* Undo changes features.
* Registry wizard.

 What We Don't Like

* Clunky interface isn't easy to work with.
* No option to select custom areas of the registry.

 Registry Distiller doesn’t look as neat as the others in this list, and the program’s interface isn’t very easy to work with or view results in. However, that being said, it apparently does a great job finding errors.

 When I tested it, it took 10 seconds to find 500+ errors, which is much better than some of the other registry cleaners in this list.

 It's said to work in Windows Vista and XP. I tested Registry Distiller version 1.03 in Windows 8 and Windows 7 and didn't have any issues.

 This free registry cleaner from SS-Tools is likely one of the easiest programs I've ever used. With barely any options, and an open, clean program window, a scan can be started in seconds.

 Only one option is available with Registry Fixer, which is to back up the registry before cleaning. I'm glad that's there, and it's even enabled by default, which is great.

 Registry Fixer is said to work with Windows XP only, though I tested version 2.0 in Windows 8 without any problems.

 What We Don't Like

* Difficult to identify which items will be removed and which will stay.

 TweakNow RegCleaner is another registry cleaner that serves as a suite with many other built-in tools.

 The registry cleaner option has a regular scanner and a deep scanner to ensure it gets as many errors and problems that it can. You can even open a particular path directly in the Windows Registry Editor to see exactly what you’re looking at.

 Something I don't like about this program is that it’s a little confusing to know which registry items you’re going to remove and which will stay intact.

 TweakNow RegCleaner works with Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP.

 What We Like

* Clean and colorful interface.
* Scans quickly.
* Option to set restore point.
* Huge collection of tools.

 What We Don't Like

* Registry cleaner is only one of 50 tools, which can be overwhelming.
* May require multiple scans to locate all errors.
* Insufficient help for new users.

 Toolwiz Care has over 50 built-in tools, one of which is called “Registry Cleanup” in the _Cleanup_ tab of the program.

 The register cleaner runs quickly, categories the errors, and removes them in nearly an instant. It even seemed to find more registry issues than some of the other programs from this list.

 An option in the settings can be enabled to automatically create a restore point before you delete any registry problems, which is a good way to safeguard against possible computer issues from the deletion process.

 You can use Toolwiz Care without installing it by clicking the "Run without installing" button when you first open the setup file. In this way, it's like a portable tool and a regular installer built into one.

 MV RegClean looks very outdated, because it is, but it seems to do well with deep registry cleaning.

 While testing this program, it seemingly found many more problems than most of the others in this list. The registry is automatically backed up, so there’s no need to do it manually.

 RegScrubVistaXP may not look modern at all, but the registry cleaning function is very good.

 This program found many more invalid registry entries than most of the programs in this list. With that being said, it’s really not the most user-friendly program out there.

 During my tests, I found it has no automatic registry backup feature, which makes it a little dangerous to use unless you remember to make a backup yourself, something you can do from within the program.

 RegScrubVistaXP is said to work with Windows Vista and XP only, but I tested version 1.6 in Windows 10 and didn't run across any problems.
