2. Highlight your images by clicking-and-dragging or hold down the**Ctrl** key and select the images one by one.

5. Adjust the image quality and choose from the layout options on the right side. Select**Options** if you want to sharpen the image. If your images appear cut off in the preview, uncheck the**Fit picture to frame** box.
