 This article explains how to comment on an[ Instagram](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-instagram-3486316) post with a GIF. You can use this feature in the Instagram mobile app on Android and iPhone, but not when[ using Instagram on the web](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-view-instagram-3486314) . As of this writing, you cannot reply to a comment with a GIF; the feature only applies to new comments.  

##  How to Comment With a GIF on Instagram 

 What says, “Congratulations,” “Way to go,” or “Good job” better than a moving picture. Whether cute, funny, or sentimental, you can comment on an Instagram post with a GIF in just a few taps.  

1. Select the post where you want to leave a comment and tap the**Comment** icon.
2. Select the**GIF** icon on the right side of the Comment field.  
 If you see a**Sticker** icon instead, select it and then tap the**GIF** icon on the bottom right.
