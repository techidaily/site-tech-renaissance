##  Why Is My Chromecast Remote Not Pairing? 

 If[ your Chromecast remote isn't working](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-chromecast-remote-not-working-8659958) correctly, it could be due to a variety of causes. Most often, however, it's possible your device is not plugged in properly, or your remote is out of battery.

 Double-check that your Chromecast is connected. You have three places to check this: the HDMI port of your TV, the point where the power cable attaches to the Chromecast, and where it plugs into the wall. Make sure everything is pushed in as far as it can go.

 You can also replace the AAA batteries on your remote if needed. Finally, try unplugging your Chromecast for a moment or restarting your router.
