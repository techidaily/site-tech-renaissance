## Planning Your Apple Store Visit? Here's How to Make a Quick and Easy Appointment
### What to Know

* Using the Apple Store App is the easiest way to get in and get your device fixed at the Genius Bar.
* You can also use the Apple Support app, which is a better option if you have several Apple devices.

 This article explains how to make an appointment using the Apple Store App. You can make an appointment for product demos, workshops, and (in most cases) repairs.

## How to Schedule an Appointment From the Apple Support App

 The Apple Support app provides troubleshooting and contact information, and it's the fastest way to get a Genius Bar appointment, especially if you own several Apple devices.

1. In the Apple Support app, sign in with your Apple ID if you receive a prompt.
2. Choose the device you're having trouble with under**My Devices** .
3. Choose the issue you're facing. For this example, we'll act like our screen is broken, which falls under**Repairs & Physical Damage** , but you might also use**Device Performance** if you think you have a software issue.
4. Select the specific problem from the next screen.

5. Select**View Locations** under**Bring in for Repair** .
6. Select an Apple Store from the map, and then choose**Schedule** .

7. On the next screen, pick an available date and time.

## Using the Apple Store App to Make Appointments

 Another way to book an appointment is through the Apple Store app, but it has a few more steps.  

1. Tap your**profile image** on the**Shop** tab in the Apple Store app.
2. Select**Reservations** .
3. On the next screen, tap**Find a store** .

4. Search for your closest Apple Store, or select one under**Nearby Stores** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

5. Choose**Make a reservation** under**Genius Bar** .
6. You'll go to Apple's support website, where you can describe your problem in the box under**Tell us what's happening** .  
 If you have the Apple Support app on your phone, the Apple Store app will direct you there instead of the website.  
![A Store, the "Make a reservation" link, and the "Tell us what's happening" field in the Apple Store app](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ircG1uYJS77_UHCiiZH0GISmswg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Apple-Store-App-Appointment-02-e508d0091eb04923ba10576b908d07ad.jpg)
7. Depending on your device's issue, the app may ask you clarifying questions. Eventually, you'll see an option to**Schedule a repair** . Choose**Find a location** to continue.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

8. If you're signed in to your Apple ID on the Support site, you can choose one of your devices. You can also select**Continue without device** if you like, or enter a serial number.
9. Find your Apple Store on the map.

10. Pick a day and time using the calculator and drop-down menu.
11. Optionally, enter your phone number if you want a representative from the Apple Store to call you. Tap**Continue** .
12. Review your reservation date and time, and then select**Reserve now** to confirm.
