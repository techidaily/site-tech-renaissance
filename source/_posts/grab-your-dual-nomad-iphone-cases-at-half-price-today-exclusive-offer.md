[Nomad Sport Case](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F9041660%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2Fzd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fsport-case-coastal-rock-iphone-15-pro-max) 

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

Nomad's Sport case is available for the various iPhone 13, 14, and 15 models. 

ZDNET's Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner says that the Sport Case for iPhone is protective, easy-to-grip, lightweight, and notes that it has a very distinctive look. 

"The attention to detail is apparent in the slight indent down the sides of the case that make easier to hold and the notched lines in the metal power button that have a wonderful tactile feel," Hiner says.
