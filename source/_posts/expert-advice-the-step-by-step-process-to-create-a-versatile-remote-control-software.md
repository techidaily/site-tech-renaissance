 A new Google TV streaming device appears to be in the works. The so-called Google TV Streamer will likely function much like the[Chromecast](https://www.lifewire.com/guide-to-chromecast-2438213) , but that's where their likeness ends. This device loses the dongle form factor and includes a redesigned remote with a customizable button.

## When Will the Google TV Streamer Be Released?

## Google TV Streamer Price Rumors

 The only reference point we have to price this new[streaming device](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-streaming-device-5208767) is Google's 4K Chromecast with Google TV, which is priced at $50\. They could easily drop that price and slot the Google TV Streamer in its place. If not, the most we can see Google charging for the Google TV Streamer is $70.

## Pre-Order Information

 Pre-orders for the Google TV Streamer will probably start immediately following its announcement on August 13.

## Google TV Streamer Specs & Features

 In the picture above, you can see that, apart from the remote, this device looks nothing like the Chromecast with Google TV. Otherwise, we think it will work exactly like a Chromecast, letting you stream music and videos from online services and cast media to it from other devices.

 According to_9to5Google_ , the source of this leak, the Google TV Streamer has a slanted surface that sort of resembles the Charging Speaker Dock used by the Pixel Tablet. Instead of a dongle that hangs off the TV, this one sits on a surface and uses dedicated power and data cables. There might also be an Ethernet port for wired internet connectivity and[Thread support for smart home connections](https://9to5google.com/2024/07/28/google-tv-streamer-fcc/) .

 The remote will get some much-needed improvements. Some of the buttons have shifted around, but most of them remain in this new design.

 One big difference is the volume buttons, which have moved from the side of the remote to the face. The other noticeable change is under the YouTube and Netflix shortcuts, where there appears to be a customizable button, which we assume can be programmed to launch any app.

 The device doesn't look that much bigger than the remote, so we're not sure what, if anything, is different about the internal hardware.
