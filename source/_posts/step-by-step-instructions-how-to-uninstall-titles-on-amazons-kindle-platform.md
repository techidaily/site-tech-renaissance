A significant advantage of eBook reading device is the capacity, even with a basic version of Kindle, you can hold thousands of eBooks with this handy size device. But every coin has two sides. As you keep adding more and more ebooks to your device, storage space will run out soon. What's worse, you need to spend a lot of time finding the book you want to read, it is high time that you should delete / remove kindle books.

**Kindle delete permanently vs remove from device:** In general, the difference between "Delete" and "Remove" is that "remove" only deleted the history for the book(we can retain them in the cloud for later), while "Delete" will delete books from the MYCD library. 

### Delete/Remove books on Kindle (Kindle Paperwhite, Voyage and Kindle Fire)

#### **General method to delete kindle books on Kindle** 

**Step 1.** On your kindle device, navigate to your Kindle library.

**Step 2\.** Press down on the cover of the book that you'd like to delete.

**Step 3\.** This will open a pop-up menu. Tap "Remove download". Your Kindle books will be removed from kindle device 

![delete kindle books on kindle device](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/delete-kindle-books-2024.png)

#### Tip: How to redownload Kindle books to Amazon Kindle again?

Books are still stored on Amazon cloud though they were removed from your device. So it's possible to redownload them onto your device again. just click on "MY LIBRARY" on the home page. Then choose "ALL" button in the top-right corner, next select the book you wish to redownload.

Of course you can also re-download your Kindle books through your Amazon account. From "Manager your Content and Device" tab click the "Actions" button, select the "Deliver to Default Device or Others" option.

![re-download kindle books](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/redownload-kindle-books.jpg)

### Delete Kindle books in batch on Kindle device

Since 11 November, 2017, Amazon rolled out a new Firmware Update 5.9.2.0.1 for its Kindle ereaders, like Kindle Oasis 2 (KO2), Kindle Oasis (KO), Kindle Voyage (KV), Kindle (Kindle 7), Kindle (Kindle 8), Kindle Paperwhite 3 (KPW3) and Kindle Paperwhite 2 (KPW2), which allows you delete Kindle books in batch.

To delete Kindle books in batch, you need to go to **Home — Menu — Settings — Device Options — Advanced Options — Storage management — Manual Removal.** Then You can manage your device storage by choosing the items you would like to remove.

![manual removal](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/manual-removal.jpg)

Or you can also go to **Home — Menu — Settings — Device Options — Advanced Options — Storage management — Quick Archive** to quickly remove content from this device that has not been opened for the last 1/3/6 months, 1 year or more.

![quick archive](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/quick-archive.jpg)

Amazon adds storage management to the new firmware, though it’s a small function, it’s really convenient for Kindle users who need to clean their storage frequently. Compared to Manual deletion, Quick Archive will easily your contents by accident. If you can’t remember all the contents in your kindle local disk, please don’t try this method.

If you want to delete books from Kindle devices in batch, make sure the Kindle firmware is 5.9.2.0.1 or above version. You can automatically update software firmware to 5.9.2.0.1 version or above on your Kindle device or download Firmware 5.9.2.0.1 manually from Amazon website.

**Notice:** All the methods above just delete the books from your device. If you want to delete them completely, you need to [remove them from Kindle Cloud](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). 

### Delete kindle books from Kindle app(Android, iOS, Windows, Mac)

#### **Delete kindle books from Kindle Android app**

To remove content from your Kindle app which installed on Android device, just find the book you want to remove from your Kindle app for Android, tap on the book cover that you want to delete for 2 seconds, then choose "Remove from device".

#### **Delete kindle books from Kindle iOS app**

You can delete books from your iPad, iPhone or iPod touch so you don't have to use your device's memory space to store them.

To remove individual book from Kindle for iOS app, simply tap and hold the cover of the book, and then tap "Remove from device" which in fact is the only choice for you.

![delete from kindle ios](https://www.epubor.com/images/delete-from-kindle-ios.png)

#### **Delete kindle books from Kindle App for Wins/Mac**

To remove individual book from Kindle for PC/Mac, right click the book cover, and then select "Remove from device" in the pop-up menu. 

![delete books from kindle for PC/MAC](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/delete-books-from-kindle-for-pc.png)

**Tips:** For a book synced from cloud, the pop out choice is "Delete permanently". For a book only exist on your device, it will be "Remove from device". 

Content that is purchased from the Kindle Store is archived and can be re-downloaded at any time; sideloaded content and personal documents that are not archived in your Kindle Library are permanently deleted.

### Delete Kindle books by deregistering your device

When we want to re-sell our Kindle device, or the Kindle device is lost or stolen, the safest way to protect our contents is to deregister our device from Amazon.

Go to "Manage Your Content and Devices" page >>> select the "Your Device" tab. Then click on the grey button "Device Actions" >>> select "Deregister". 

![deregister kindle](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/deregister-kindle.jpg)

Please keep in mind that this will remove all the contents from your device. You are not able to download or buy any more until your device is registered with another Amazon account.

![deregister yes](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/deregister-yes.jpg)

### Delete books from Kindle Unlimited

With Kindle Unlimited we can borrow books (up to ten books) but no need to pay for them. But once finished reading, they will be still saved in our account. In this situation we can delete them from Kindle Unlimited history.

You just need to "View My Kindle Unlimited Library", and then "Return this book".

![return kindle books](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/return-kindle-book.jpg)

Tips: 

1\. Kindle Unlimited allows you to borrow 10 books at a time. So if you borrow more than 10 books, you will be asked to delete one in Kindle Unlimited library.

2\. Books will be gone when you cancel your Kindle Unlimited subscription.

### Delete books from Kindle Cloud: delete kindle books permanently

**Update:** If your Kindle firmware was updated to 5.12.5, there’s also the option to permanently delete purchased ebooks and personal documents from the Kindle itself. 

Before you do this, please make sure you understand that if you delete a book from your Kindle Cloud, you will not be able to read it any more unless you purchase the book again. In other words, you are giving up your ownership of this book by deleting it from your Kindle Cloud.

If you navigate to this part, I can see you really have a pretty strong mind to clean up your Kindle archives. **Now let's remove contents from Kindle Cloud permanently(deleted them off the website).**

1) Login to Amazon.com and go to **"Manage Your Content and Devices"** page. In this page you can see all the items in your Kindle Cloud, which means they can be synced to all your registered Kindle devices and apps.

2) Select the books you want to delete, and then click on "Delete" button.

![delete from kindle cloud](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/delete-from-kindle-cloud.png)

3) Then it will pop up a warning window, click "Yes".

![delete from kindle cloud warning](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/delete-from-kindle-cloud-warning.png)

 **Wrapped up:** 

If you delete books from your library/cloud/archive, you can never have the books back. This means that you have to purchase for a second time if you want to read them again. Still want to delete kindle books from your Kindle account but need a back-up? Please use [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) tool which helps remove the drm from your Kindle books and back up them to your computer for good.

### Delete Rented Kindle Books

For users borrowing ebooks from the library, typically, rented books are automatically returned to the library when the Kindle book lending period expires. However, the expired Kindle Books may still appear on your Kindle device or reading app, and they cannot be opened. To delete such Kindle books, please follow the steps below.

1 Go to "[Content & Device](https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/digital-console/contentlist/allcontent/dateDsc)" page on Amazon's website.

2 Select the book you want to delete, and click "Delete". In the prompted new window, choose "Yes, delete permanently".

![delete from expired rented library kindle books](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/delete-expired-rented-kindle-books.png)

#### Make sure your kindle books are backed up before permanently deleting them 

If you are determined to delete your purchased Kindle books, ensure that they are safely backed up on your computer. To help yourself back up kindle books, please follow this guide: [How to Back up Your Kindle Books to Computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

Hi Susie,  
 If you keep a book on the device, and directly delete it in Kindle Library Management page, then the book on your device will not disappear. But if you delete a book on both device and Kindle Library Management page, you are not to able to download it again.

So to delete an item from both the cloud and the device, you need to delete it twice? In the article above it says if you delete from the cloud it will disappear from the device also.

And you also need to delete them on your device. And make sure you hadn't sync other contents.

 Delete books definitely won't take more space.

I really appreciate your doing this as my Kindle app on my iPad was getting kind of trashy/messy looking.   
 However, you may want to make a note of the following: as I was deleting titles from my device page I noticed that the dialogue box that popped up said something different than what you quote here. It said: "Delete Permanently" over "Add to Collection". As I was only deleting samples and one (horrid) book that I got by mistake I opted to click on Delete Permanently. You might want to check this out. It could be different post OS 7.  
 Again, thank you.

Hi,

 If the book is synced from your cloud library, then you will see "Remove from Devide".

 If the file doesn't exist in the cloud but just on your device, you will see "Delete permanently".

 However, I will explain this in the article. Thanks for your feedback.

Well, I'm pretty techno-literate and it was driving me NUTS that I could NOT find a way to quickly and intuitively delete a book from the Kindle App I downloaded to my iPad Air. Thank you for solving this so elegantly.

I followed all directions posted on all of my devices and under the Manage My Content section on amazon but I STILL had the deleted book covers showing up on my kindle for PC app. When I left click it only gives me the option to purchase the book or to add it to a collection, which I don't sort my books by collection anyhow. I tried right clicking and then hitting the delete button. Nothing. Wiped all kindle books off my laptop and emptied the recycle bin. Still no change. This has been an issue for me for years literally. I had given up. I decided to google around for a solution today and still could not get the covers off my app. The PC app has changed over the years but currently under Library you see ALL and DOWNLOADED. I had removed all books from my laptop and so under downloaded I had 0 but under ALL I had 101\. I only actually own 41 kindle books. The rest are book covers from library ebooks I have checked out and have now expired and I have either used the return feature under manage my content or for expired books used the delete for ever option. STILL these books are on my PC kindle app.  
 FINALLY I stumbled upon a solution. The images are cached under the appdata file. I got all the 'ghost' content off my PC by deleting the cache file. Then I opened the app and re-synced.  
 SO step by step: 1\. Find your Kindle XML File named "KindleSyncMetadataCache.xml"  
 It will be located here (the default _location)_: C:\\Users\\YourUserName\\AppData\\Local\\Amazon\\Kindle\\Cache  
 "YourUserName" will be your username on your computer. 2\. Delete the file. It will regenerate when you next open and sync the kindle app. Now your PC kindle app will match whatever you have in the cloud.
