## Smart Texting Strategies: How to Stay Connected without Exceeding Your Data
 You can do more with texting (or SMS) than send brief messages to friends. If you pay for a text messaging plan or texting is included in your plan, you may not need the mobile web, which consists of browser-based internet services that are accessed from mobile devices such as smartphones, and affects data usage. Instead, use text messaging.

 Texting from a mobile phone is part of a cellular call system's[Short Message Service](https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-sms-text-messaging-578676) (SMS). Sending a text doesn't use data allowance, but unless SMS is included in a monthly plan, there may be a small fee for each text.
