## Is It Time for a New Phone? Understanding the Right Moment to Switch
0:38

### How Often Should You Upgrade Your Phone?

 Figuring out if you should upgrade your Android phone is tricky. Many factors go into the decision, and each person places different importance on them. New Android phones always come out, but almost no one needs to get every new model from their favorite brand. So, how do you figure out[when to upgrade your Android](https://www.lifewire.com/new-android-phone-or-wait-1616824) ?

## How Long Do Android Smartphones Usually Last?

 Generally speaking, Android smartphones last 3-5 years, but many factors can shorten or extend their lifespan. The most crucial factor in how long an Android phone lasts is how you treat it. A phone you take good care of lasts longer than one you drop, soak with water, or otherwise mistreat.

 The other key factor in how long an Android phone usually lasts is whether it was top-of-the-line when you bought it. A high-end phone lasts longer than a basic phone because it has more storage, a faster processor, a better camera, and other advanced features that keep it useful longer than a bare-bones model.

 The last factor in how long a smartphone usually lasts is what you expect from it. If you need the fastest performance and the latest features, you'll upgrade your phone much more often than if you need a basic camera, texting, web browsing, and the ability to play some games.  

 To make your phone last as long as possible, we recommend protecting it with[a case](https://www.lifewire.com/best-android-cases-4050600) ,[cleaning it regularly](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-phone-screen-4688907) ,[freeing up storage space](https://www.lifewire.com/free-up-space-on-android-5101088) when you're low, being smart about security,[staying up to date with your operating system](https://www.lifewire.com/update-your-android-os-121662) , and only getting repairs from authorized providers.

## How Often Should You Get a New Phone?

 Gone are the days when it made sense for most people to get a new smartphone every year. Back then, each new model brought such significant advancements that frequent upgrades made sense. Not anymore. New smartphone models only bring incremental improvements these days, so it's reasonable to wait.

 On average, you'll probably want to get a new phone every 2-4 years, depending on how you use it and the condition of your current phone.

 If you demand a lot from your phone—high speed and graphics performance for games, powerful processing for video, high-end photography—you'll always need to be close to the cutting edge and probably want to upgrade closer to every two years.

 The average user can wait longer, assuming your phone still meets your needs (more on that in the next section).

 You should also pay attention to any contracts you signed with your current phone company. Depending on promotions and the terms of your current plan, there may be restrictions on how often you can upgrade.

## Do You Need to Upgrade Your Android Smartphone?

 Whatever kind of user you are, how do you know if you need to upgrade your Android smartphone? These are the questions we suggest you ask:

* **Is your phone too slow?** The speed and responsiveness of most phones decrease over time. There are[ways to speed up an Android phone](https://www.lifewire.com/make-android-faster-7105795) , but a slow phone is a good reason to upgrade.
* **Is the battery no longer holding a reasonable charge?** Many Android phones have replaceable batteries. Price out the cost of a new battery. But if the battery and something else aren't meeting your needs, upgrading the whole phone might make more sense.
* **Do you have enough storage?** Many Androids have expandable storage, but a new phone usually provides more storage space.
* **Does the camera meet your needs?** The feature that most reliably improves on new phone models is the camera. If your current phone camera doesn't meet your needs, an upgraded model likely will.
* **Is your phone cracked or damaged?** If the body or screen of your phone is cracked or damaged, or if ports, buttons, or speakers don't work correctly, it may be better to invest in a new phone than a repair.
* **Can you still get Android OS updates for your phone?** Running the latest Android version on your phone is essential for security and privacy. If your phone can no longer get major Android OS version upgrades, you may want to consider a new one.

 Answering "yes" to just one of these questions may not be reason enough to upgrade (but you'll know what makes sense for you and your budget), but if you answered "yes" to a few of them, it's probably time for a new phone.
