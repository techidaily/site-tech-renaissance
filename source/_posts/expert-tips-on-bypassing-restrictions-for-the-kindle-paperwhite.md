With the development of Android and iOS devices, jailbreak is no longer so strange to people at present. After jailbroken we can easily modify our device and add some new and interesting features which the native system doesn't support. We've written an article of [how to jailbreak Kindle Fire](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) that has helped many Kindle Fire users. Today we'll show you how to jailbreak another popular Amazon ebook reader – the Kindle Paperwhite.

You may be confused of jailbreaking Kindle Paperwhite as it's only an e-ink eReader which runs Linux. It does not have various features like the Android-based Kindle Fire. Actually jailbreaking a Kindle Paperwhite will give you much convenience. For example, you can change the wallpaper. I bet you have been tired of the original wallpaper for a long time. Wanna change it? Just jailbreak your Kindle Paperwhite first!

### Jailbreak Kindle with Firmware Version 5.3.0/ 5.3.1/ 5.3.4/ 5.3.5

Due to the fact that Amazon has made much limitation on their devices, jailbreaking Kindle device is more difficult than others like the Android phones. In this section, the jialbreak method only applies to _**5.3.0**_, _**5.3.1**_, _**5.3.4**_ and _**5.3.5**_. Tap the setting icon at the home page to enter setting menu. Then tap the setting icon again and choose "Device Info" from the drop down menu. You'll see the Kindle Paperwhite's firmware version.

####  Step 1\. Change Kindle Paperwhite OS version

If your OS version is _**5.3.0**_, _**5.3.1**_, or _**5.3.5**_, you don't need to change the OS version. Just go to [step 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) directly; if your OS version is _**5.3.4**_ or _**5.3.6**_, you need to upgrade or downgrade it to _**5.3.5**_. The following is the tutorial for upgrading/downgrading Kindle Paperwhite OS version.

1\. [Click here to download _**5.3.5**_ OS .bin file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/G7G%5FFirmwareUpdates%5FWebDownloads/update%5Fkindle%5F5.3.5.bin)

2\. Turn Kindle Paperwhite into airplane mode and connect it to computer. Copy the .bin file to the root directory.

3\. Eject Kindle Paperwhite. Choose menu – setting – menu – Update Your Kindle. Then the device will reboot and you will see an upgrading progress bar. After several minutes the upgrading will finish. You can check the OS version again to see if the Kindle Paperwhite has updated to _**5.3.5**_.

#### Step 2\. Install jailbreak files

At this step, we need to put the jailbreak files into Kindle Paperwhite. [Click here to download the jailbreak zip file](https://storage.gra.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH%5F2ac4bfee353948ec8ea7fd1710574097/mr-public/Touch/kindle-jailbreak-1.16.N-r18981.tar.xz). Extract the zip file and you will see these files:

![jailbreak-files](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/3-jailbreak-files.jpg)

Connect Kindle Paperwhite to your computer. Now you need to put these files into different directories of your device: Put _**MOBI8\_DEBUG**_ and _**jailbreak.sh**_ in the root directory and put _**jailbreak.mobi**_ in the "documents" folder. Just leave the _**README.txt**_ alone.

![put-files-at-root-directory](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/4-put-files-at-root-directory.jpg)

![put-files-in-documents-folder](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/5-put-files-in-documents-folder.jpg)

Eject the device and you'll find there is a new personal document at home page.

![new-document](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/6-new-document.jpg)

Open this file and click the "Jailbreak" link on the first page.

![open-jailbreak-document](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/7-open-jailbreak-document.jpg)

You must try these methods step by step. When the jailbreak procedure has been done, you can update your firmware to the latest version with the effective jailbreak. Learn the details of [how to update your Kindle firmware](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

With these methods, you can jailbreak Kindle Paperwhite or other Kindle versions freely. If you have tried above methods and succeed, please leave your Kindle versions through the comment column to give others a reference.

### Jailbreak Kindle Paperwhite3-4GB & Paperwhite3–32GB with Firmware 5.8.9.0.1 

The jailbreaking method provided in this section only applies to Kindle Paperwhite 3 with firmware 5.8.9.0.1 including Paperwhite 3 - 4GB and Paperwhite - manga 32GB (both devices are without special offers). Your mileage may vary if your device is with Special Offers or you have Special Offers enabled. For example, you may encounter boot loops when the factory firmware starts the first time. And if your device is passcode accessible or/and parental controls enabled, you probably will not bring your device back to normal from such boot loops. So I strongly recommend you to remove Special Offers and disable password access and parental controls before you perform the jailbreak.

#### **How to remove Special Offers from your Kindle Paperwhite 3?**

Click the menu icon from the home screen of your Kindle Paperwhite3;  
Go to “Settings”-->My Account-->Special Offers;  
Turn off “Special Offer Filtering’, “Home Screen Special Offers”, and “Screensaver Special Offers”.

Besides, please pay attention to your Kindle’s registration. Any change to the registration status (such as switching account, deregistration) will make you face the risk of losing the application keys install by the hotfix package. You may have to re-install the hotfix if you change registration status.

To ensure the jailbreak runs smoothly, you also need to block OTA updates before connecting your Kindle device to internet, so as to prevent firmware from updating automatically. Please create an OTA blocker directory folder under your Kindle root directory, and rename the folder to **update.bin.tmp.partial**. Use the exact folder name, don’t add file extension or put any contents into the folder.

Then please perform the steps written in the previous section in this article [“Jailbreak Kindle with Firmware Version 5.8.x”](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) as it share the same jailbreak procedure. Only the specific firmware for Paperwhite 3 and hotfix package need to be updated. Please set your Kindle Paperwhite to airplane mode and make sure it is fully charged during the procedure.

Download the specific firmware for Kindle Paperwhite 3:

For the last updating your Kindle Paperwhite firmware version part in the previous section of the article, please refer to [how-to-downgrade-kindle-firmware-2017](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/), but take notice of the following modification:  
For Paperwhite3 – 32GB, please don’t use the firmware link in that article, but use [this file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/firmwaredownloads/update%5Fkindle%5Fall%5Fnew%5Fpaperwhite%5F5.8.9.bin) or get a 5.8.9.2 or newer firmware from Amazon. (5.8.10 or 5.8.11 are also ok).

I can't get my Kindle to revert to previous firmware version... when i move the bin file over to the kindle and then disconnect, the 'update your kindle' field is grayed out. when i reconnect the kindle to the computer, the bin file is gone.... i can't find anything online about this.

I have the exact same problem and I too cannot find any workaround for this many month after you posted this. Arrrgh. Can somebody update this to tackle this isue? It would apear that Amazon intentionally did this to block jailbreaking.

Finally, today I didn't unplug the Kindle at all, I just kept the power button pressed for something like 30 seconds and it started the "update" procedure which successfully completed. Now I will just do what I had to do from the beginning, jailbreak it.  
 So, if you have the latest firmware, just copy it in the root and press the power button of the Kindle long enough. Don't bother to close the Kindle directory on the computer - it will close by itself.  
 Good luck and thanks to the people who came with the idea!

 The OS is now back down to 5.3.5

1\. Disable wifi on your Paperwhite 1 (airplane mode).  
 2\. Connect your Kindle Paperwhite 1 to your computer (DO NOT DISCONNECT UNTIL LAST  
 STEP!).  
 3\. Copy the .bin file you downloaded to root folder of Kindle.  
 4\. Wait at least 2 minutes after copy has completed. (it required to make sure the file is copied).  
 5\. Push and hold power button until your Kindle restarts (the led blinks orange and  
 light turns on at the screen).  
 6\. Wait until the Kindle has installed the upgrade (really a downgrade).  
 7\. Now you can DISCONNECT from your computer.

I followed Bob's instructions above and it worked. I have a 2012 Paperwhite Kindle and the latest possible OS version was 5.6.1.1\. It wouldn't let me downgrade to 5.3.5 by following the instructions on this post.

 \-Plug in Kindle to desktop via USB  
 \-Move the update\_kindle\_5.3.5.bin file to the Kindle root directory  
 \-Do not unplug Kindle from Computer  
 \-Hold the Kindle's power button for about 30 seconds  
 \-I got a message that I didn't eject the device properly, but then my Kindle automatically started updating to 5.3.5

worked well, successfully downgraded firmware on a Paper\*\* 3\. everything worked up until step 5..... jailbreak files missing

 Suitable for Kindle Oasis, Kindle Voyage, Kindle Paper\*\*\*te 2/3, Kindle Touch 2/3

 1\. Download main-html\*viewer\*tar\* (WORKS)

 2\. Plug your Kindle device in a computer. When the Kindle disk displays, you can copy "main\*html\*\* file to the Kindle root directory (at the same level with the documents folder). (WORKS)

 3\. Eject your Kindle device. At the home page of your Kindle device, you can see the search bar. Enter ;installHtml and confirm. The semicolon is a part of the contents you must input. (WORKS)

 4\. After the above steps, if the Kindle screen flashes and Kindle begin to reboot, it means you keep the right pace and you can continue the rest of the procession. (WORKS)

 5\. Download Jail\*\*\*\*\*hot\*fix\*zip (THIS STEP DOESN"T WORK, asterisks added so the bots would let me post this question)

  
 When clicking the link on step 5...... takes to the mobil\*read page, but the "Kindle PaperWhite 3 (2015)" option is grayed out with no link. All the instructions on the mobil\*read page and the other links lead to other firmware versions... not 5.7.4 that was just installed. I'm afraid to try installing a wrong jailbreak firmware file.

Do you think it will be possible to jailbroke for v5.12.1 in the near future?

Since you can't downgrade the kindle firmware 5.12.1 to older version, so you cannot jailbreak it any more.

 Sorry for the inconvenience.

Hey, I have a PPW3, firmware 5.12.5  
 Can this be jailbroken? Do I need the jailbreak for managing collections with calibre?

"Part 5\. Jailbreak Kindle PaperWhite 4 with Firmware Version 5.10.2-5.13.3"  
 Part 5 has a broken link:  
 FW 5.10.1.3 Diags which directs to https://mega.nz/file/fjYCAbxC#qGYDDn...lppriic\_CB6oio  
 Mega.nz says the decryption key is invalid. Maybe this is because the key #qGYDDn...lppriic\_CB6oio has three dots because something shrunk it and deleted characters? For example the file "FW 5.10.1.3 Factory"'s key is a lot longer: #qrjmx6KI156yAUcHF4\_1s-gYl4Vp9N3JHaaw-da0VXQ and directs to valid file. Thank you in forward :)

I really hope you can provide a method for downgrading the latest firmware (5.13.7) with its laggy and ugly interface!

Same question as OilyBlob from 10/4\. Can someone please tell us? I'd like to buy a new Paperwhite during Black Friday sales but even the previous generation model apparently comes with 5.13.6 and I have many ePubs I don't want to convert. It's a PITA plus some don't convert correctly. So if I can't put a native ePub reader on it, I won't buy.

hi,

 thanks for your great HowTo. Now my PW 10th Generation is Jailbroken and Firmware 5.10.13  
 Do you have a source for firmware 5.13.3? All links I found are linked to amazon and there I can find only Firmware 5.14.2

 Thans for any download Link
