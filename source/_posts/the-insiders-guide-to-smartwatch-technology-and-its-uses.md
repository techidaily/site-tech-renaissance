 There's no question that the internet holds all the best places to watch free music videos. There are many websites to pick from, but these sites stand out to me for several reasons: they have a bunch of videos, let you make playlists, and offer great recommendations. Definitely check them out, whether you're looking for the latest chart-toppers or timeless classics.

 What We Like

* Endless content.
* Includes well-known and up-and-coming artists.
* Lots of ways to find videos.
* Updates often with new videos.
* Build and share playlists.

 What We Don't Like

* Ad-supported.
* Countless non-music videos can get in the way.

 It's probably not surprising to see YouTube make this list. It's one of the only places I've found where I can watch the latest free music videos from all my favorite artists. Another reason it's my first choice is because it does a wonderful job helping me discover up-and-coming musicians.

 There are lots of ways to find music videos here, like via a keyword search, genre categories, and even by mood. I recommend using[the Music channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9-kyTW8ZkZNDHQJ6FgpwQ) if you're not sure what you're in the mood for because you can browse by new, trending, mood, and more.

 YouTube works from your phone, tablet, or TV.

## [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MusicVideos/?rdt=55145)

![Top music videos on Reddit](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C4HfKDj1W-ekxIDQVWifY5fol7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/reddit-top-music-videos-c87a02d5df534537ba1f898399aedda4.png)

 What We Like

* Unique videos from many sources.
* Engage with other users.
* See all the top-rated music videos.
* An active community updates the page often.

 What We Don't Like

* The comment section isn't always kid-friendly.
* Frequent sponsored posts.

 The /r/MusicVideos subreddit is another great place to find music videos online. There are tens of thousands of members here, so you're bound to see some new videos posted often.

 What makes Reddit unique for streaming music videos is that you'll find submissions from a variety of websites, so even if you've already used the other sources in this list, Reddit is the next best place to see videos from elsewhere.

 You can sort submissions by what's hot right now, the newly added ones, and today's or this year's top-rated music videos. The extremely popular[Music subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/?rdt=35481) also sometimes includes videos.

* Lets you subscribe to updates.
* The interface is clean and simple to navigate.

 What We Don't Like

* Not nearly as much content as similar sites.

[Our Review of Vimeo](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-vimeo-3486114)

 Vimeo is another big name in this space. This streaming music video website includes tens of thousands of videos to look through. You can make an account and follow the channel for upload notifications.

 Otherwise, you can watch music videos on Vimeo for free without a user account. The site is fairly easy to navigate and there are tons of music videos you've probably never seen anywhere else, which provides a fun way to find some new things to watch.

 You can view these music videos by date uploaded, alphabetically, popularity, or duration. There are also filters for defining things like duration, upload date, resolution, HDR, license, and mature content.

 Vimeo is available for computers, smart TVs, and mobile devices.

 What We Like

* View music videos by country of production.
* Open a random music video.

 What We Don't Like

* Doesn't seem to update much anymore.

 Most if not all of the music videos at The Internet Music Video Database (IMVDb) are sourced from YouTube, but I include it in this list because I like the different ways it lets me find music videos.

 The website curates a list of the best new music videos on the home page and maintains a list of the top music videos of all time. You can also see IMVDb's best videos by year through their Year in Review lists for 2015 through 2018.

 When I'm not sure what I'm in the mood for, I like to open IMVDb's random music video link â€” it's always something I haven't seen, which is really cool.

## [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/musicvideobin)

![Music Video Bin at Internet Archive](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mXMRLJyw4r3YgcnTpNy2vLPbxkw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/internet-archive-free-music-videos-ece67d529a9f418a8c21ccd5069a11c9.png)

 What We Like

* Lots of older content you might not find elsewhere.
* You can download the music videos.

 What We Don't Like

* Not the best place for anything modern.
* Website is often slow.
* Subject filtering is a mess.

 Internet Archive is known for its archive of all sorts of internet content, and the Music Video Bin is one example of its music video collection.

 Videos span from the mid-1900s to the present year. You can filter by year, but also creator, language (nearly all of it is in English), collection, and subject.

 There are several thousand results through the link below, but Internet Archive also has the more general and much larger (millions of items)[Audio Archive](https://archive.org/details/audio) that has other videos sprinkled within its subcategories for you to uncover.

 The biggest issue I have with this site, and why I've ranked it where I have in this list, is the difficulty in finding something good to watch. The inconsistent subject filters make them almost useless to use. And if you venture outside the link below, you'll have a hard time finding music videos among the trove of information available on this site (movies, books, software, etc.).

 What We Like

* Includes unique content.
* No user account required.

 What We Don't Like

* Focuses mainly on music news.
* Not as much content as similar sites.
* Lots of clips and narrated videos.

 Yahoo provides free music videos throughout its coverage of music-related news. They have videos of performances and live feeds from music festivals and events. There's also the occasional interview with artists.

 In addition to the link I've provided below, I also recommend browsing[Yahoo's video page](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tagged/videos/) for more.
