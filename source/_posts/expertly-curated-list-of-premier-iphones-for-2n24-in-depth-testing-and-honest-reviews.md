Jason Hiner/ZDNET

Samsung's Galaxy S24 range, the latest in the tech giant's product line, includes the base Galaxy 24 model, Galaxy 24+, and premium Galaxy 24 Ultra.

One of the top deals at AT&T is for the mid-range option, the Samsung Galaxy 24+. While its full $1,000 retail price translates into $27.78/month, you can pick up this device for free with the suitable trade-in of an older device. You will need to agree to sign up for a qualifying unlimited plan, but to sweeten the pot, AT&T will throw in free Samsung Galaxy Buds FE earbuds.

If you need to pick up more than one handset, choosing a Samsung Galaxy S24 Series model, Galaxy Z Flip5, or Galaxy Z Fold5 means you will receive enough in bill credits to bring down the cost of a secondary Samsung Galaxy S24 to $5.99/month. No trade-in is required. AT&T will also give you a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds FE for free.

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

As we noted in our hands-on review, the new Google Pixel 8a is a mid-range phone with a flagship-tier display, solid performance, and power packed into a compact design. 

This mobile device is currently available for pre-order. AT&T has elected to launch a promotion which means that you can pick up this device for $5.99/month (reduced from $14.45/month) without trade-in. In addition, pre-ordering the Google Pixel 8a will net you a free Pixel Watch 2 and 50% off a pair of Pixel Buds.

AT&T

If you want a top-tier Android device, Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra smartphone will likely interest you.

AT&T will give you up to $1,000 off the typical retail price of $1300 with the trade-in of a suitable, older device. You will also need to agree to sign up for an eligible plan. Additionally, AT&T will throw in a pair of free Samsung Galaxy Buds FE.

The same promotions as above are available for this handset -- purchasing another eligible Samsung smartphone will allow you to pick up a Samsung Galaxy S24 for $5.99/month without a trade-in. 

You can pick up the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in four titanium finishes: violet, black, gray, or yellow.

June Wan/ZDNET

If you want a substantial upgrade to your existing iPhone, you can save up to $1,000 when purchasing the Apple iPhone 15 Pro -- in other words, you'll pay nothing beyond your typical usage charges each month.

Retailing for $999 at the entry storage level (128GB), you can pick up the device for free when you trade in a suitable device. The discount is applied in bill credits over 36 months. The iPhone 15 Pro is available in black, natural, blue, or white titanium.

With any purchase of an Apple iPhone, if you add a 9th-gen iPad and/or Apple Watch SE to your basket, you can enjoy these devices for only $0.99/month.

Samsung/ZDNET

If you're more interested in a flip phone, AT&T has an interesting deal on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5\.

If you purchase a qualifying device, AT&T will provide bill credits toward another, bringing down the cost of the Samsung Galaxy S24 to $5.99/month.

Four colors are available: mint green, lavender, cream, or graphite. Plus, the company will give you free Samsung Galaxy Buds FE earbuds.

## How did we choose these AT&T phone deals?

When we made our selection for the best AT&T deals, we wanted to include options based on the following criteria: 

* **Value:** The deal had to offer good value for money, especially regarding trade-in offers or discounts applied to new handsets, tablets, or entertainment products.
* **Affordability**: The economy is facing an uncertain time, and when we experience this type of disruption, it is sometimes essential to reduce our expenses as much as possible. With this in mind, we have included products suitable for various budgets.
* **Variety:** We require a diverse range of products to be available, suiting different users and their needs.
* **Free products**: Devices drop in value over time, and to offload excess stock, some carriers will launch time-sensitive deals, giving subscribers free products in exchange for signing up for a new contract.
* **Events**: It's always worth checking retailers after a major event, such as Samsung Unpacked. You will often find that deals will be launched just after, luring customers to agree to preorder their new handset in return for discounts and free storage upgrades.

## Does AT&T offer deals for existing customers?

It's true that carriers are the most aggressive with their offers when it's year-end and new customers are shopping around for services to switch to. Still, AT&T has done a fairly balanced job of pushing promotions for new and existing customers, including all the deals we have listed above. If you've been a loyal customer, we'd even recommend reaching out to your local AT&T provider to see if there are any exclusive deals just for you.

## Is it cheaper to buy a phone online or in-store?

In general, there is no difference in how much money you save whether you shop online or in stores. Instead, deciding between the two really boils down to your preference for transactions. With how complicated carrier phone deals can be, you may be better off heading down to the local AT&T store and consulting with a product expert to help you navigate the fine print. Otherwise, shopping online can be faster and more convenient.
