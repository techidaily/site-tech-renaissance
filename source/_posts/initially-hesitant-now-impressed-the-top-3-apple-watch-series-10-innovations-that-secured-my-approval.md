[iPhone launch day](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-we-expect-at-apples-iphone-16-event-ai-features-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-more/) is something tech enthusiasts and everyday consumers can mark on the calendar every September. Apple's early autumn event has become as synonymous with the fall season as the return of pumpkin spice flavored drinks at Dunkin' and Starbucks alike. The day is highly anticipated and full of excitement -- and [this year's 'It's Glowtime' event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-we-expect-at-apples-iphone-16-event-ai-features-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-more/) didn't disappoint. 

The Cupertino-based company unveiled its newest iPhone lineup, the [iPhone 16 series](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-compared-which-new-iphone-should-you-buy/), and the next generation of its popular Apple Watch, the [Apple Watch Series 10](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-10-gains-sleep-apnea-detection-and-it-could-save-your-life/), on the wearable's tenth anniversary, the [Apple Watch Ultra 3](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-apple-watch-is-getting-an-upgrade-here-are-the-best-features-in-watchos-11/), and a [more affordable Apple Watch SE](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-most-affordable-watch-se-model-may-be-getting-a-revamp-soon-heres-whats-new/).

The Watch Series 10 is the latest release since Apple debuted the [Watch Series 9](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/) last year, and the [Watch Series 8](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-8-review/) back in 2022\. A new Watch SE (3rd Gen) was unveiled, too, refreshing the [previous iteration](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-apple-watch-se-is-just-60-off-this-memorial-day-and-its-my-favorite-purchase-this-year/) released in 2023, and finally, the Watch Ultra 3 levels up on the older [Ultra 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-the-apple-watch-ultra-2-is-a-near-perfect-wearable-for-me-and-its-100-off-for-labor-day/), also released last year. 

Early [reports indicated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-06/apple-sept-9-event-preview-iphone-16-apple-intelligence-airpods-and-watches?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNTYyNDM5NSwiZXhwIjoxNzI2MjI5MTk1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSkUxOEVUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIxM0JCRDY1RkVFM0Y0NzY5ODBCRDRDNEVEMTM3OTgzQiJ9.MPWBQNeeBUl0coxAyGzWo%5FiUwjzuG1BXK%5FpuBiFP1x0) small tweaks to the Ultra model, more affordable materials to construct the Watch SE, and a much-needed facelift to the mid-range Watch Series 10 -- the first major design upgrade since the [Watch Series 7 in 2021](https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-apple-watch-series-7-first-impressions/). Those rumors [were confirmed](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/09/introducing-apple-watch-series-10/) at the event.

The all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the thinnest model yet and is available in 42mm and 46mm face sizes. It's also lighter with more rounded corners and a wider aspect ratio. Its OLED display is also 40% brighter than the Series 9 watch. Beyond physical appearance, the Series 10 has several key upgrades, including an updated Smart Stack, on-watch Translator, [sleep apnea detection](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-10-gains-sleep-apnea-detection-and-it-could-save-your-life/), Depth and Tides apps, speaker playback, and [more Apple Intelligence features](https://www.zdnet.com/article/buying-an-apple-watch-series-10-consider-these-3-features-before-upgrading/). 

The Apple Watch Series 10 is available for [preorder](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) starting today and will be available September 20\.

## You should buy the Apple Watch Series 10 if...

### 1\. You want a thinner design or larger watch sizes

For the first time since the Watch Series 7 in 2021, the Apple Watch has had a facelift. The new Series 10 has a thinner overall profile and features larger faces and more rounded edges. Choose from a 42mm or 46mm display and enjoy a wearable lighter than the previous Series 9\. So, if you've been avoiding an Apple Watch because you've wanted a slimmer profile or larger face, here's your chance. 

### 2\. You'd benefit from sleep apnea tracking

Sleep tracking is all the rage in tech (seriously, ZDNET readers [frequently purchase](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-25-most-popular-products-zdnet-readers-bought-this-month-august/) sleep-aiding techs like earbuds, masks, and more), and it's become increasingly popular in wearables, such as [smart rings](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smart-ring/). If you want top sleep-tracking features in your Apple Watch, the new Series 10 is your model. 

**Also:** [**The best smart rings: Expert tested**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smart-ring/)

Brand new for the Series 10, sleep apnea tracking is now built-in and there's a host of other features, such as [depth gauge](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-vs-series-10-which-smartwatch-is-right-for-you/), for sports like snorkeling and diving.

### 3\. You're looking for something future-proof

If you're spending a few hundred dollars on a smartwatch, you want it to last for several years without compromising performance or function. The best way to ensure you're investing in an Apple Watch that's future-proof and compatible with all of Apple's most up-to-date features (and [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-delivers-on-hardware-upgrades-but-punts-apple-intelligence-rollout/), of course) is to select the newer model. 

The Watch Series 10 is the newest Apple Watch you can buy. History suggests it will remain so at least for the next year, which means the device will be sure to receive all the latest and greatest WatchOS software and obtain updates for longer, even if a Series 11 is eventually released. 

**Also: [Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Series 10: Which smartwatch is right for you?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-vs-series-10-which-smartwatch-is-right-for-you/)**

Not only does the Watch Series 10 offer new features like sleep apnea detection, temperature sensing, and a depth gauge, but it's also designed to maximize [WatchOS 11](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-apple-watch-that-will-get-watchos-11-and-which-models-wont-be-supported/) and benefits from a seamless integration with Apple's latest [iPhone 16 models](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-compared-which-new-iphone-should-you-buy/), which run on [iOS 18](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-be-updated-to-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/). 

### 4\. It's time to upgrade

If you own a Watch Series 7 or older, you may be looking to surrender your current everyday driver and opt for something fresher. As we inch closer to 2025, the Series 7 is close to being four years old, and any model that precedes that device probably feels a bit outdated or is perhaps experiencing performance dips. Last year I upgraded my Watch Series 3, which I purchased in 2020, to a [Watch SE (2nd Gen)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-apple-watch-se-is-just-60-off-this-memorial-day-and-its-my-favorite-purchase-this-year/) after experiencing glitching issues and poor battery life. The difference has been astounding. 

**Also:** [**The best Apple Watches you can buy: Expert tested**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/)

If you want top functions and maximum longevity, the new Watch Series 10 is the most up-to-date model to upgrade to. However, even a Series 8, 9, or Watch SE model might be perfect for your needs, especially if you have a smaller budget for an upgrade.

### 1\. You want an affordable option

If you want to experience the integrated benefits of the Apple ecosystem on your wrist or upgrade your smartwatch without breaking the bank, older models, such as the [Series 8](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-8-review/) or [Series 9](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/), are a great way to save a few dollars while still nabbing excellent features. While the Series 8 lacks the updated elements offered in the Series 10 (and even the Series 9), it's still a solid watch with the ability to do many of the basic tasks users require: track workouts, manage calls and texts, sync with your iPhone, and more. 

**Also:** [**Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Series 8: Which model should you buy?**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-vs-apple-watch-series-8/)

While the [Series 9](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/) has been available for [upwards of $150 off](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-9-With-Blood-Oxygen-GPS-Cellular-41mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-S-M%2F5031676480%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds%26%26adid%3D222222222275031676480_156221679273_18387865360%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D677785081658%26wl4%3Dpla-2228157757188%26wl5%3D9192199%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D5031676480%26veh%3Dsem%26gad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwufq2BhAmEiwAnZqw8qlhlHZgVBlgIzIofDP3CSyc29wH8YwdGFvBqUfPmphFZr9oKyfkTRoCL_cQAvD_BwE&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) lately, the Series 8 is often even more affordable. You can find [refurbished options](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C2VT692T%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ce90d8758-e40e-423d-a620-cb7430205f2b%7Cdtp&dtb=1) for under $250, though a major downside is this model is increasingly hard to find, especially in new condition. 

### 2\. You're looking for blood oxygen sensors

A major reason you may be interested in the Series 8, even though it's now a few years old, is the blood oxygen feature. Since the blood oxygen sensor [was banned](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-removes-blood-oxygen-sensor-from-new-watches-what-does-this-mean-for-current-users/) for the Series 9, Ultra 2, and as expected, the Series 10, no newer Apple Watch model offers the same capabilities. This situation means the Series 8 is the best option if you're looking for an Apple Watch equipped with blood oxygen sensing.

## Alternatives to consider

[Best Apple Watch alternative Apple Watch Series 9 If you're deciding between the newest Watch Series 10 and the older Watch Series 8, it's worth considering the slightly newer Watch Series 9 released a year ago. Though no longer sold with a blood oxygen sensor, the Series 9 is still a solid watch with great health and wellness features. In fact, it's been ZDNET's pick for best Apple Watch for most individuals for the last several months over more affordable models like the Series 8 or SE (2nd Gen).
