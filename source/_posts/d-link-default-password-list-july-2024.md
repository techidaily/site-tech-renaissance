## D-Link Default Password List (Valid July 2024)

 This table lists default usernames, passwords, and IP addresses for various D-Link models. I gathered these only from official sources on D-Link's website, including support pages and user manuals. However, if you don't see your device or the default data below doesn't work, see below the table for more help, including what to do.

| **D-Link Model**                                                               | **Default Username** | **Default Password** | **Default IP Address** |

 \[1\] The D-Link DI-634M router has two default access accounts, an administrator-level account (username of_admin_ ) that is used for router management and a user-level account (username of_user_ ) that is used to view data but not make changes.

 \[2\] D-Link DI-701 routers have an administrator-level default account (no username or password required), as well as another administrator-level account for ISPs called Super Admin (no username with a password of_year2000_ ) that grants the additional ability to set a user limit via the_usrlimit_ command, available in the router's terminal mode.

 \[3\] These D-Link routers, the DSA-3100 and the DS-5100, have default administrator accounts (_admin_ /_admin_ ) as well as default manager accounts (_manager_ /_manager_ ) which are restricted to adding and managing additional user access accounts.

## When the D-Link Default Password or Username Won't Work

 There are no secret back doors to a D-Link router or another network device, meaning that if the default admin password has been changed and you don't know what it is, you're locked out.

 The solution is to reset the D-Link device to its factory settings, which resets the password to its default and erases the wireless network and other settings.

[Best Ways to Reset a Home Network Router](https://www.lifewire.com/resetting-a-home-network-router-818061)

 To perform a factory reset on a D-Link, turn on the device, press and hold the Reset button (usually on the back of the device) with a paper clip or small pen for 10 seconds, then release it. Wait a few minutes for the router to finish booting.

 If the factory default reset doesn't work, or you can't find the Reset button, check the device manual for specific instructions. A PDF version of the device manual can be found at[D-Link Technical Support](https://support.dlink.com/) .

 After the D-Link admin password is reset, change it to something secure that can't be easily guessed. Then, store the new password in a[password manager](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-password-managers-work-5186454) to avoid having to reset it in the future.

## When the D-Link Default IP Address Won't Work

 If your D-Link router is powered on and connected to your network, but the default IP address listed above doesn't work, open a web browser and connect to <http://dlinkrouter.local>.

 If that doesn't work, connect to http://dlinkrouter_WXYZ_ , with_WXYZ_ being the last four characters of the MAC address for the device. All D-Link devices have their MAC addresses printed on a sticker located on the bottom of the device. So, for example, if the MAC address of your D-Link router is 13-C8-34-35-BA-30, go to <http://dlinkrouterBA30> to access the router.

 If that doesn't work, and your D-Link router is connected to a computer, the configured default gateway is the access IP address for the router. Learn [how to find the default gateway IP address](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-find-your-default-gateway-ip-address-2626072) , then look for the IP address in your computer's network settings.

 If you need help accessing or troubleshooting your D-Link router or have questions about default passwords and other default network data, read the [Default Passwords FAQ](https://www.lifewire.com/default-passwords-faq-2619155) .

## Don't Forget to Change the Default D-Link Password

 The router's default password exists for one reason: to get into your router after you purchase it. This easy-to-guess and easy-to-find password should _not_ stick around throughout the life of your router.

 It's crucial to[change your Wi-Fi router's password](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-router-password-2624476) after logging in with the default one shown above.
