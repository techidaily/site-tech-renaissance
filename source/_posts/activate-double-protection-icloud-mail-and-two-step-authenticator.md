 The Apple cloud storage system,[iCloud](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-icloud-3972867) , includes a free web-based email account. This account can be accessed from any Mac, Windows, or iOS device using the iCloud website or the Mail app.[Two-factor authentication](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-two-factor-authentication-4686242) protects your iCloud Mail account from theft, hacking, and other misuses by unauthorized parties.
