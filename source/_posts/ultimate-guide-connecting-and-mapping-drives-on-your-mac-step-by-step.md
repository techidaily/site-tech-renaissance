## Ultimate Guide: Connecting and Mapping Drives on Your Mac - Step by Step
### What to Know

* Launch**Finder** and then select**Go** \>**Connect to Server** from the menu.
* Enter the path for the network drive and select**Connect** . Click**Connect** again to confirm.
* Drag the shares into the**Login Items** section of System Settings to auto-mount them after a reboot.

 This article explains how to set up a[mapped drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mapped-drive-2625932) on a Mac and how to reconnect to the shared folders automatically after a reboot. These directions are for Macs running macOS Sonoma, but they can easily be adapted for other versions of macOS.  

## How to Map a Network Drive on Mac

 Instead of downloading or copying the same data to all your devices, save the files in a single folder and then share the folder with your other devices. With the shared folder ready to go, follow these steps to map the network drive:

1. Launch[Finder](https://www.lifewire.com/use-mac-finder-2260739) .  
![Launching Finder](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/huJvgSnOo0nc6KBEwczoAZROP0Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/launchfinder-340aa8e12df54fcdb7a00d5f690fffc5.jpg)
2. Click**Go** \>**Connect to Server** . If you prefer to use the keyboard, press**Command** +**K** .  
![Go > Connect to Server](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/o4nzpFECIMhhjSy946PTVqi6NkI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/go_connecttoserver-015046850f824f41874453979f22fb61.jpg)
3. Enter the path to the network drive and then select**Connect** . It should start like this in most cases:  
 `smb://`  
![Connect to smb](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/LGGVIx8-2eXACqoDFGFx2WQEuCk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/connecttosmbserver-d55cf0e3c30f47eb8775f220506ce07f.jpg)
4. If you're prompted for a confirmation, click**Connect** .  
![Confirm server connection](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0seVxpQZnWQ2lKqukB2EbRbeD44=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/confirmserverconnection-5f5a46f9f44d44739284b5b6ccfc692b.jpg)  
 Accounts that don't have permission to access this file/folder are unable to create a connection to the network drive.
5. Once the network drive has been mapped, it will appear under the**Locations** menu in any Finder window, and on your desktop (if not, go to**Finder** \>**Settings** and turn on**Connected servers** ).

 Since mapped drives show up as mounted drives on your macOS device, you're able to disconnect from them by ejecting the drive.

## How to Auto-Mount a Network Drive on macOS

 To automatically connect to your favorite network drives after a reboot, add them to the Open at Login area of System Settings.

1. Click the **Apple logo** and then choose**System Settings** or, if you're using an older version of macOS,**System Preferences** .

2. Search for**Login Items** , or select it from the**General** menu.
