## Comprehensive Solutions for STOP 0X0000001D (NO_SPIN_LOCK_AVAILABLE) Issue on Windows Systems
 One of the errors below or a combination of both errors may display on the STOP message:

* **STOP: 0x0000001D**
* **NO\_SPIN\_LOCK\_AVAILABLE**

 The STOP 0x0000001D error may also be abbreviated as STOP 0x1D, but the full[STOP code](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-stop-code-2625685) will always be what's displayed on the blue screen STOP message.

 If Windows is able to start after the STOP 0x1D error, you may be prompted with a_Windows has recovered from an unexpected shutdown_ message that shows:  

 `Problem Event Name: BlueScreen`

## How to Fix STOP 0x0000001D Errors

 The STOP 0x0000001D STOP code is rare, so there's little troubleshooting information available that's specific to the error.

 However, since most STOP errors have similar causes, there are some basic troubleshooting steps to help fix these issues:

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't already done so. The blue screen error might not occur again after rebooting.  
 If you can't restart normally, pressing the power button on your computer is fine. This isn't normally recommended, but since Windows hasn't started yet, it's fine to do so here.
2. [Perform basic STOP error troubleshooting](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-a-blue-screen-of-death-2624518) . These extensive troubleshooting steps aren't specific to the STOP 0x0000001D error, but since most STOP errors are so similar, they should help resolve it.

 There's also a[system error code](https://www.lifewire.com/system-error-code-2625996) that goes by 0x1D, and it has the description "The system cannot write to the specified device. ERROR\_WRITE\_FAULT." The fix for that is different from the steps listed above.

 If STOP 0x0000001D isn't the exact STOP code you're seeing or NO\_SPIN\_LOCK\_AVAILABLE isn't the exact message, check our [List of Blue Screen Error Codes](https://www.lifewire.com/blue-screen-error-codes-4065576) and reference the troubleshooting information for the STOP message you're seeing.
