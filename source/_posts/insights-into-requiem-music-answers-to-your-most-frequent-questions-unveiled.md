**Requiem** is a powerful open-source free ware, but we can hardly lend on their official site. And there is no Requiem Forum on the Internet, all these above lead to our diffuculties in **removing iBooks DRM**.

Here are more details about how to use requiem: [http://answers.yahoo.com/rss/search;\_ylt=](http://answers.yahoo.com/rss/search;%5Fylt=AgY.R8SiROx76Hqbdswcm7QjzKIX;%5Fylv=3?p=requiem+3.3&scope=all&fltr=%5Fen&question%5Fstatus=all&date%5Fsubmitted=all&category=0&answer%5Fcount=any&orderby=rank)

I have already did everything like you said above.  
 I still got the message: "key store version too new. You need a newer version of Requiem"  
 and another message:  
 "Key not found. Can iTunes play this file?"  
 Can you help me with that problem?  
 I used ifunbox to get all the key files from the ibook inside my ipad. I noticed that all the HTML files extracted from epub is encrypted and cannot read.  
 I'm a C programmer and Java newbie. Can you give me instructions on how to compile the source code. I want to change something hopefully can make it successful decrypting all my ibooks and be able to read on my computer.   
 Do I need a mac to compile?   
 Another question is: Is there command line interface so that I can give all the information that Requiem need for decrypt? May be there's some missing information while Requiem trying to find all the information to decrypt.  
 Thank you so much for your help and your time!

What's your iTunes version? Requiem 3.3.5 can not work perfectly on iTunes 10.6 yet. If there is a new version of Requiem, we will update our page asap.

I'm using iTunes 10.6  
 Do you think it's possible if I uninstall 10.6 and install 10.5 then Requiem will work? or I cannot downgrade..  
 After install 10.5 do I need to sync with my ipad before running Requiem; or just Authorize the computer, download and run Requiem.  
 Thanks

Hi,  
 I'm very happy to tell you that I have successfully removed DRM of all my ibooks.

 I used another laptop install 10.5.3.3, authorize, download, install java 32 bit and Requiem all the ibooks; reading freely on lapto now!

 Thanks! Requiem is rock! :D

 Anyway, try this link again.

BTW, in the links I offered in the Requiem Download page, you can find the history iTunes Version in the left.   
 So you can find it yourself if my link above still doesn't work.

Bookmarked this page. Do you know how long it usally takes for Requiem to update to work with the newest iTunes?

[Re:ThePonyGuy](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

04/3/2012 21:41:40

It depends, I guess it will take long for next version, because iTunes has updated the DRM method.   
 For 3.3-3.3.5, it took only one week for 2 updating, because those are tiny updating for a better Java-supporting and bugs-fixing.  
 I guess next version will called "Requiem 3.4".  
 Once it release, I will update our page immediately.

 For removing HD video DRM, we can't offer you solution with Requiem 3.3.5.

Before re-download, have you deleted the whole iTunes Library folder and the eBooks in your iTunes Program?  
 I use PC, I don't know whether Mac version needs Java, if yes, install the 32-bit Java.

Ignore my original post I now realise the reason it wasn't working on my new book is because it didn't have any DRM on it. Would be good if the program could recognise this and let the user know.

I can't remove the book's DRM even if you send it to me. Because it needs your iTunes ID.

I am also getting the "Key is too old" error. I uninstalled iTunes 10.6, downloaded and installed iTunes 10.5.3.3 and Requiem 3.3.5\. I tried using A. A. Milne Winnie the Pooh, which is a free book, so you can test using your own account and see what you get.

Hi Epubor.Fors, I did as you told but I still have a problem. I'm using Vista 32bit OS. I've uninstalled iTunes 1.6.1.7, deleted all program files and folders, installed iTunes 10.5.3.3, uninstalled and reinstalled JRE 1.6.31, re-downloaded the ibook but Requiem gives me the error: "The following files could not be decrypted: xxxxxxxxxxxxx.epub (java.lang.NullPointerException)". I've tried with JRE 1.7.03 as well with no success. Help will be greatly appreciated, thanks.

Hi,  
 What matters is not the version of JRE, but the bit.  
 It's better to install 32-bit JRE.
