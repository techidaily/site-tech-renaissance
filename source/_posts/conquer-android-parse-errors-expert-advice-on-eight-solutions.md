## Troubleshoot Verification Errors on Your Mac – Easy Solutions Inside
 By default, macOS allows users to install only approved apps from developers registered with Apple that have verified their apps for use on Macs. When the developer of an app doesn't register with Apple or skips the verification process, you'll see a "Cannot Be Opened Because the Developer Cannot be Verified" error when you try to install the app.

 When this error occurs, the app won't install or open and you'll typically see an error message like:

* "(App name) can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer. Your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the App Store and identified developers."
* "(App name) cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified."
* "(App name) can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software."

## What Is the Cause of the ‘Cannot Be Opened Because the Developer Cannot Be Verified' Error on Mac?

 While[Macs are less likely to get viruses](https://www.lifewire.com/can-macs-get-viruses-4767114) than Windows PCs, they can still get infected. Apple has a developer ID system and an app review process to reduce the frequency of users exposed to malware on macOS.

 Developers must register with Apple, and they have to submit their apps for review. If an app is free of malicious code like malware, the app is signed and approved.

 When you try to install an app from a developer who hasn’t registered with Apple, you’ll see an error message. If a registered developer releases an app that Apple hasn’t reviewed, the same thing happens.

 If an app were released before the registration and review processes started, it would trigger the same error. The app may be safe, but there’s no way for Apple to know one way or the other if they haven’t been able to review it.

## How Do You Fix ‘App Can’t Be Opened Because It Is From an Unidentified Developer?’

 To fix the error where you can’t open an unapproved app on your Mac, you have a few options.

1. [Look for a newer version of the app](https://www.lifewire.com/using-mac-app-store-4171845) . Check the Mac App Store and see if the app is available there. If you downloaded it from a different source, you might have an old version of the app. The developer may have released a signed and verified version in the App Store since then.
2. Look for an alternate version of the app. Check the Mac App Store to see if an app from an approved developer does the same thing. If you can find an app that performs the same functions, and it’s from an approved developer who has gone through the verification process, consider trying that app.
3. Override your security settings. If you’re sure you trust the app developer, you can allow the app to install and open. From Finder,**Control+Click** the app > click**Open** .  
 The app should be saved as an exception in your security settings, allowing you to open it in the future.
4. Bypass the block in your Privacy & Security settings. If the previous method didn’t work, you can do it manually from**System Settings** \>**Privacy & Security** \> look for the app > click**Open Anyway.**

![The Open Anyway option from macOS Privacy & Security settings to allow an app from outside the App Store.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q44hkOY6O8L2Ck_LybCHimjWrBg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_fix-developer-cannot-be-verified-error-5183898-889a356e9c644d86962bc4ccc9ad1be9.jpg)  
 In older versions of macOS, open**System Preferences** \>**Security & Privacy** \>**General** \> click the**lock** icon > enter your username and password >**Unlock** \>**App Store and Identified Developers** . You may see the option to click**Anywhere** \>**Allow From Anywhere** .
5. [Download the app through Safari](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-safari-4173608) . If the above process didn’t work, make sure you downloaded the app using Safari. Delete the app > restart your Mac > download the app using Safari > and try to run the app. When you get the error message, perform the Privacy & Security fix outlined in the previous step.  
 There’s an issue where downloading apps through other browsers, like Chrome and Edge, will cause a problem when trying to install unsigned apps.

 FAQ

* Why can't I verify my Apple ID?  
 If you're logging into iTunes, the Apple Store, or another Apple service and you encounter a verification error, such as, "Verification failed. There was an error connecting to your Apple ID," there are a few fixes to try. First, see if there's a problem with Apple Services by going to[Apple's System Status page](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) . Ensure you're connected to Wi-Fi and that the network is up and running. Try logging in on another Apple device, such as an iPad or iPhone, and see if you can get verified there. If you have more than one Apple ID, try logging out of any devices that use the secondary Apple ID. You can also try restarting your device, logging out of your Apple ID and back in, or disabling ad blockers or a VPN.
* How do I verify my phone number for my Apple ID?  
 Open your[Apple ID two-factor authentication](https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-two-factor-authentication-on-iphone-4799065) settings. On an iPhone or iPad, tap**Settings** \>**Apple ID** (your name) >**Sign-In & Security** \> go to T**rusted Phone Number** \> tap**Edit** . On a Mac, click your**Apple ID** \>**Sign-In & Security** to add a trusted number. Alternatively, you can go to the[Apple ID website](https://appleid.apple.com/) and sign in with your Apple ID. Go to the**Account Security** section and follow the prompts to add a verified number.
* How do I bypass Mac app verification? It's taking too long to open programs.  
 Some users experience the problem of apps loading slowly while the Mac verifies them. You'll see a loading bar with a "verifying app" message, even with familiar apps like Microsoft Word. It's a separate issue from the "unidentified developer" error. To solve the slow "verifying app" problem, make sure you[update to the latest macOS](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-a-mac-5119468) . Download and install any available app updates. If the problem persists with one particular app, try removing it and then downloading it again.
