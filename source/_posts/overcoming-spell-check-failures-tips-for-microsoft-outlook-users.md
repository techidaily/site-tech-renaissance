## How Does Microsoft Verify Student Enrollment?

 When you request the student discount at a physical Microsoft store, you need to show your student ID or some another supporting document like a class schedule, transcript, or acceptance letter.

 When you use the[Microsoft student discount online](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/education) , Microsoft doesn't require up-front verification. That means you can take advantage of the student discount without proving you're enrolled at a qualifying school, or that you're even a student at all.

 When you use the Microsoft student discount online, you agree to let Microsoft contact you at a later date for verification. If you're contacted, you have to provide proof of enrollment. If you're unable to prove you're a student, you have to pay the difference between the student discount price and the full price of the items you purchased.
