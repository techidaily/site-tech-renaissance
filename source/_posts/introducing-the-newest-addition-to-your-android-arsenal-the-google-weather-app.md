## Introducing the Newest Addition to Your Android Arsenal - The Google Weather App!

Google just announced a new weather app, exclusively for its newly announced line of Pixel devices. The app uses generative AI to quickly summarize weather reports. It’s also fully customizable, so you can prioritize the information that matters to you the most.

 The new Pixel Weather app, available in [Pixel 9](https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/1722964871657-install-logitechs-high-performance-g29-driving-force-racing-wheel-on-your-pc-driver-support-for-win7-8-and-10/), Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and the [Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-car-locator-apps-for-poco-x6-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), is built on Gemini Nano. [Gemini Nano](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/supercharge-your-screens-with-video-enhancer-v22-for-2024/) is Google’s latest on-device AI model, designed to run even without Wi-Fi or data. It’s part of Google’s plan to rebuild Android “with AI at the core.”

 Pixel Weather uses this model to reportedly create more precise and accurate weather reports. Google says it’ll let you view granular metrics “like when the rain is going to start and stop.” Gemini Nano presents those reports in clear bullet points, so you get everything relevant about the current weather at a glance, without scrolling through a bunch of figures. For example, it could tell you to pack sunscreen or an umbrella depending on the kind of weather you’re having.

 Secondly, the Pixel Weather app has a [Material You](https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-perfect-shots-essential-photography-edits/) themed modular design, meaning it features floating tiles for each section. The current temperature and weather conditions are shown at the top of the app, against dynamic backdrops. Everything else in the app can be moved and repositioned. There are dedicated carousels for hourly forecasts and 10-day forecasts. Expected precipitation levels, humidity, air quality, sunrise and sunset timings all go in their separate dynamic tiles. The app also features four beautiful rounded badges that show wind, UV index, visibility, and atmospheric pressure info. You can rearrange any of the tiles, carousels, or badges to bring the relevant info into focus.

 Google has also optimized this app for the new foldable, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, splitting the app interface into two neat columns when it’s unfolded, which removes the need for scrolling.
