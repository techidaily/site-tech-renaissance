## Causes of Yahoo Mail Delivery Problems

 Depending on how the issue presents itself, several things could bring Yahoo Mail down. Generally speaking, however, the major causes are:

* Account issues
* System interruptions
* User Error

 Some of these causes have direct solutions, while others may require you to wait for the system to sort itself out.

## How to Fix It When Yahoo Mail Is Not Receiving Emails

 These solutions should apply to all versions of Yahoo Mail running on the web or mobile devices.

1. [Check your spam folder](https://www.lifewire.com/review-yahoo-spam-folder-periodically-1167134) . Yahoo's automatic bulk-mail filter does a decent job of making sure unwanted emails don't get to your inbox, but it makes mistakes occasionally. You should check the spam folder to see if the email(s) you're expecting accidentally ended up there.  
 If you find non-spam emails in the bulk folder, be sure to[safelist the senders](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-safelist-email-addresses-4588603) to make sure their messages get through alright in the future.
2. [Take a look at your filters](https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-filter-yahoo-mail-1167129) . Yahoo Mail includes a feature that helps you automatically sort messages as soon as they arrive. It's a convenient feature, but like spam, it's possible that a filter you set up could grab emails you don't intend it to.  
 Before you hunt through all of your folders, check the Filters section in your Yahoo Mail settings. Doing so will help you identify and fine-tune the rules you've set up if any problems exist. You can also check your filters to see which folders they use to help narrow down your search.
3. Look for a "Reply-to" address. One feature of Yahoo Mail lets you[specify a different email address](https://www.lifewire.com/specify-reply-to-address-yahoo-1174533) for your recipients to reply to. If you set one, their replies won't go to your Yahoo inbox, even if you sent them from that account. Check the Mailboxes section of your settings to make sure all of your messages are going where you want them to.  
 If you have an active reply-to address, check that account for the missing emails.
4. Check your blocked address list. It's possible that one reason you aren't receiving emails from a particular recipient is that you've blocked their address, whether intentionally or not. To check for blocked emails, go to the Security and Privacy section of your settings.  
Yahoo Mail arranges blocked email addresses alphabetically.
5. Send yourself an email. Even if you can access your Yahoo Mail account, it doesn't mean the service is working correctly. One way to see if the delivery system is functioning is to send an email to your account and see if it reaches the inbox.  
 If something's wrong with the platform, you may receive a message with a specific error code that you can look up to get more of an idea of what's going on.
6. Sign out and back in. If you're[using the Yahoo Mail mobile app on Android](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-the-yahoo-app-on-android-4781598) or iPhone, you may lose the connection between it and your account. Logging out and back in may help re-establish the link.  
 Even if you're accessing Yahoo on the web, this technique may still be useful.
7. Reset your browser. It's possible the data and cookies you've accumulated while browsing could affect how websites, including Yahoo, behave. Try just closing and restarting first, and if it still doesn't work, You can easily[reset Chrome](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-google-chrome-to-its-default-state-4103626) or[restore Safari](https://www.lifewire.com/restoring-safari-default-settings-446560) .
8. Try a different Yahoo Mail platform. If you aren't receiving emails on the website, for example, try accessing it through your phone's dedicated mail client or the official Yahoo Mail app.  
You can also try using a different web browser.
9. Make sure everything is up to date. Yahoo Mail updates behind the scenes, so you don't necessarily know when a new version is up. Some changes may mean that the platform won't work on the current version of the browser or app you have installed, so you should check for updates and see if that helps the issue.
10. Contact Yahoo. If none of these solutions work, you should[reach out to Yahoo support](https://www.lifewire.com/contact-yahoo-mail-support-1174475) so a representative can walk you through additional troubleshooting steps.
