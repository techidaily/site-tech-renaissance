## Configure Anything with These Simple Steps for a Universal Remote Control
### What to Know

* First, put the control into pairing mode by holding some combination of the**Device** ,**Power** , and other buttons.
* Enter codes from the manufacturer's code sheet, either included or online.
* Instructions may vary by manufacturer; check the manual or their support page for exact steps.

 A universal remote makes it easier to control your TV and other components. Here are some general steps for how to set one up to manage a variety of devices.

[How to Program an RCA Universal Remote](https://www.lifewire.com/program-rca-universal-remote-5201320)

 Specific programming options and steps may vary with each universal remote control brand and model. The following are examples of options you might see and steps that may be required.

## Direct Code Entry

 The easiest way to program a universal remote is to enter a code that identifies the product you wish to control. Codes may be provided via a "code sheet" or a web page where the codes are listed by brand and type of device (TV, Blu-ray Disc player, Home Theater Receiver, Cable Box, VCRs, and sometimes media streamers).

1. Turn on the device you want to control.
2. Press and hold the appropriate button on your remote (some models require that you press a Setup button before pressing the device button). The LEDs for the device and power buttons will light up.  
 Although the buttons may be labeled for a specific device, you can use them for any compatible device; you must remember which one corresponds to the device you are controlling.
3. With the device button on the remote held down, enter the code for the brand of the device. If a brand has more than one code, start with the first one. As you enter the code, the power button on the remote will turn off.
4. After entering a code, keep holding down the device button. If the control's power button lights up and stays on, you have entered the correct code.
5. If the power button blinks several times, then the code you entered is not correct. Each time you are unsuccessful, repeat the code entry step for each code until one works.
6. After programming, see if the universal remote controls the basic functions of your device. For example, a universal remote should turn a TV off and on, change the volume, channel, and source input.  
 If you're using Direct Code Entry, write the successful code(s) in your user guide for later reference.

## Auto Code Search

 You can use Auto Code Search if you don't have access to the specific code for the brand or type of device you wish to control. The remote will search through its database, testing several codes at a time.

 Here is an example of likely steps:

1. Turn on your TV or another device you wish to control.
2. Press and release the**Device** button on your remote associated with the product you want to control (TV, etc.). As mentioned previously, you can use any device with any of the labeled buttons—remember to write it down.
3. Press the Device Button again, as well as the**Power** button at the same time. The power button will turn off and then come back on again.
4. Release both buttons.
5. Press and release the**Play** button on the remote, and then wait a few seconds and see if the device you are trying to control turns off. If so, then it has found the correct code. If your device is still on, press the play button again and go through the waiting and turn-off process. Repeat until your device powers off.
6. Next, press and release the**Reverse** button on your remote every two seconds until your device turns back on. When it finally does, the remote has successfully searched for the correct code.
7. Press the**Stop** button to save the code.
8. Test several functions on the remote and see if they work for your device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Brand Code Search

 Using a similar procedure as Auto Code Search, you may be able to narrow down your search to just a single brand. This search comes in handy if the brand provides more than one code.

 Here are the steps:

1. Turn on the device you wish to control (TV, VCR, DVD, DVR, satellite receiver, or cable box).
2. Locate the Brand Code(s) from the list provided with your remote.
3. Press and hold the**Device** button you wish to program. (TV, DVD, Aux, etc.) When the LED for that button turns on and remains on, keep holding down that button.
4. While holding the device button, press and hold the**Power** button, the power button should light up.
5. Release the power and device button. The device button should remain on (if not, repeat the steps).
6. Using the universal remote's keypad, enter the first code of the brand. The LED light for that device button should then remain on.
7. Press and release the Power button repeatedly until the device you are trying to control turns off. If the device turns off, the remote has found the correct code.
8. Press the**Stop** button on your universal remote to save the code (the LED light will turn off).
9. Use several buttons (volume, etc.) to see if your remote can now control the device.
10. If your device doesn't turn off and the LED light blinks four times, you've exhausted the codes for that brand and need to use another programming method.

## Manual Code Search

 Instead of having the remote scan through all, or brand, codes automatically, you may also be able to program the remote by having it check each code one at a time. However, keep in mind that this process can take a long time since there are so many codes.

 These are the steps to initiate this option:

1. Turn on your TV or another device you wish to control.
2. Press and hold the corresponding**Device** and**Power** buttons on the remote at the same time. Wait until the power button comes on, and then release both buttons.
3. Pointing the remote at the TV or another device, press the Power button on the remote and wait 2 seconds.
4. If the power on your TV or device turns off, the remote has found the correct Code. Press**Stop** to save the code.
5. If your device fails to turn off, press the**Power** button again so that the remote tests the following code in the database. Perform this step until it finds a code.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Programming via IR Learning

 If supported, the IR learning method requires placing your universal remote and the remote of a device you wish to control so that they are pointing at each other. This process allows IR control light beams to transmit from the original device remote to the universal remote.

1. Press the appropriate device button: TV, etc.
2. Activate the learning mode for your universal remote. If there isn't a Learn button on your remote, you will need to consult the user guide to determine which one performs this function—not all Universal Remotes support this option.
3. Press a button on the universal remote (such as volume up), and then press the corresponding function button (volume up) on the device's remote.
4. Repeat these steps for every function you wish to run, such as volume down, channel up, channel down, and input selection.

 This process is long and tedious, especially if you have several devices you want to control. However, if you don't have access to the remote control codes or other methods fail, you may be able to use the IR learning process as your last result, provided your Universal Remote supports this programming option.

## Programming via PC

 Another programming option available for some remotes is with a PC. One brand that supports this option is[Logitech Harmony](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/harmony-universal-remotes) .

 Instead of searching for the correct code, you plug a Logitech Harmony Remote directly into your PC via a USB connection. Then you do all your programming online through the Logitech Harmony website, which not only has a continually updated database of about 250,000 control codes but saves all your programming setup preferences for easy access when needed.

 The typical setup includes:

1. Select or enter your Logitech Harmony Universal Remote Control model number**.**
2. Designate the types and brands of devices you wish to control.
3. [Create Activities](https://support.myharmony.com/en-us/understanding-harmony-activities) that allow you to turn on and perform several additional tasks across multiple devices at the same time.

## The Bottom Line

 A universal remote is a great way to clear that space on your coffee table, but also keep the following in mind:

* A universal remote is not always an entire[replacement for your original remote](https://www.lifewire.com/replace-remote-control-3276136) . Some only control basic functions, while others may provide access to advanced picture, sound, network, and Smart TV or home control feature settings. However, you may still need to use the original remote for some or all advanced features, so store it and some batteries, where you can easily find them.
* Not all universal remotes can get updates.
* When shopping for a remote, take note of what programming options are available.
* Check if the remote has a temporary memory that stores control information for a few minutes when changing the batteries. Otherwise, you may have to reprogram the remote.
