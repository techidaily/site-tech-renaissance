## Best Free Internet Faxing Applications - Find the Top Picks
 Faxing may seem outdated, but many organizations still conduct business via fax. There's no need to invest in a fax machine or computer fax modem, however. Free online fax services allow you to send faxes from your computer and receive them in your email.

 The free fax offerings from these services may have limited features. Read carefully before choosing one.

## [FaxZero](https://faxzero.com/)

![FaxZero free online fax service](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/w4MzU4pr8HGqyFmCik3ULuf2ZBs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/fax-zero-59433d515f9b58d58af4751b.png)

 What We Like

* Great for very limited faxing needs.
* Faxes straight from Word files.

 What We Don't Like

* Daily limit of five faxes.
* Includes ads on the cover page.
* No way to receive a fax.

 With FaxZero, send a fax for free anywhere in the United States and Canada, as well as many international destinations. Upload a document or PDF file or enter the text you'd like to fax. There is no fax-receiving function, however.

 The free service places an ad on the cover page and is limited to a maximum of three pages per fax and up to five free faxes per day. If you need to send more than three pages, send a fax of up to 25 pages with priority delivery and no advertising on the cover page for $2.09\. This service is accredited by the Better Business Bureau.

 What We Like

* Great for people with consistent but low-volume fax needs.
* OCR and document-search capability.
* Online storage.

 What We Don't Like

* Weekly fax receipts to keep your number.
* Can't send faxes.
* Only 30 days of fax storage.

 FaxBetter Free gives you a dedicated toll-free fax number, allowing you to receive up to 50 pages per month. You'll get email notifications every time you receive a fax. FaxBetter Free stores up to 1,000 pages on its site for you to access your faxes online.

 However, you can't send faxes using this free fax number, and the fax-to-email service, as well as the OCR/searchable fax feature, is free only during a 30-day trial. Additionally, you agree to browser ads when using the free version.

 If you expect to receive many faxes or want to send faxes in various formats, the FaxBetter Premium account starts at $5.95 per month for up to 500 pages per month, and two cents per page after that (although, at this price, you have to pay upfront for two years). This plan also includes unlimited fax storage, searchable fax notifications, and no advertising.
