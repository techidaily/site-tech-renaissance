### Tip 1: Choose a reputable Internet browser

 First things first, we recommend using a reputable Internet browser to ensure the basic security, like**Google Chrome** ,**Microsoft Edge** ,**Mozilla FireFox** ,**Apple Safari** and etc. These browsers can protect you from most phishing contents and malware.

 Next, you can**customize the security settings** of your browser to increase its security.

Here are some examples of the security settings in Chrome you can set:

 a) Turn on the**Safe Browsing** feature. With Safe Browsing enabled, Chrome is able to protect you and your devices from dangerous sites.

 b) Enable â€˜**Ask before accessing** â€˜ of the**location** setting.

 c) Enable â€˜**Ask before sending** â€˜ of the**notification** setting.

 There are many other security settings you could check from the**Privacy and security** setting in Chrome. You can also check the specific security settings of other browser you using through the Internet.

### Tip 2: Check sitesâ€™ security before you go

 To keep safe online, you should also**make sure the site youâ€™re going to visit is secure** .  
 Here are some methods you can follow to determine sitesâ€™ security:

 a) Go to the**HTTPS** pages instead of HTTP pages.

 HTTPS, is the**secure version** of HTTP and the S at the end means secure. All your communications between your browser and the website are encrypted on HTTPS pages.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c2f0fdc6b18d.png)

 b) Another way to determine if a website is trustworthy:**look at the security status on the left of the web address.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c2f102b0dd86.png)

<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 b-1) If the status shows as a**padlock** , youâ€™re visiting a secure site.  
 That is to say, information you send or get through the site is private.

 b-2) If it shows as**an info mark** , the site isnâ€™t using a private connection.  
 You can try to delete http:// and enter https:// instead to see if it works.

 b-3) If it shows as**a red exclamation mark**  , the site is not secure or even dangerous.  
 We highly recommend you do not enter any private or personal information on this site. If possible, donâ€™t visit any site with a red exclamation mark.

 c) Before you click any links on websites,**hover the link to double-check the destination** the URL links to.

[Try hovering your mouse cursor over here](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , but do not click, you should then see the URL that it links to at the bottom left of your browser: <https://www.drivereasy.com/>

 If you canâ€™t tell where the link leads to, youâ€™d better not proceed.  

**Important:** Do not click any URLs on phishing emails or from unexpected messages.

### Tip 3: Hide your IP address with VPN

 Suppose youâ€™re using a reputable browser to visit secure sites, the next step you need to make sure your device is**connect to a safe network** . However for some reasons, you would use a public wireless network sometime at airports, hotels, coffee shops and etc. In this case, we recommend **using Virtual private network(VPN) service to hide your IP address** for browsing safely.

 A VPN is a secure tunnel that can hide your IP address and location. Itâ€™ll also encrypt all your communications so that youâ€™re able to browse freely while your device is connected to public Wi-Fi. Even your ISP (Internet service provider) wonâ€™t know which websites youâ€™ve visited if youâ€™re using a VPN. Besides, you can view blocked websites from anywhere with a VPN.

 There are many VPN services you can choose through the Internet. Keep in mind that choose a green and safe one. We recommend **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for your best pick. Hereâ€™s how you can use NordVPN to browse the web safely:

 NordVPN is offering special deals for a limited time. Check out **[Nordvpn Coupons and Promo Codes](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to get a discount â€“ up to 83%! ðŸ™‚

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install NordVPN on your device.

 2) Click**Sign up as a new user** and follow the on-screen instructions to sign up and log in.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c04f8c899a82.jpg)

 3) Click**Quick connect** to automatically connect to the server recommended for you. Or you can also connect to a server in a specific country by clicking on the country pin on the map.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 **Important:**
 Youâ€™ll just need to pay $2.99 per month for a 3-year plan of using NordVPN and youâ€™ll get a 30-day money-back guarantee.  
 Please**do not use any free VPN service** as they may make their money in some other ways like selling your data to marketers.

### Tip 4: Get help with a reputable anti-virus software

 A trustworthy anti-virus software can block viruses, malware, hackers, ransomware, and malicious websites and warn your of risky downloads and sites. So you can also get help with a reputable anti-virus software to strengthen your online security.

 If you find it difficult to determine whether the anti-virus software you select is trustworthy, we recommend using **[Malwarebytes](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Itâ€™ll protect you from threats that traditional antivirus isnâ€™t smart to stop.

### Tip 5: Update your operating system and software regularly

 Companies release**security updates** from time to time, you can check if thereâ€™s any available updates both for your operating system and software regularly.  
 We highly recommend you install any available updates on your device in case of hackersâ€™ taking advantage of the security problems.

 Usually you can check updates for an operating system from the System Settingâ€™s options and updates for software from the app store or the official website of the software.

### What else you might concernâ€¦

 Besides the tips above, hereâ€™s some other easy-following tips you can keep in mind for safe browsing:

1. Download software or any content from**trusted sources** , like official websites.
2. **Clear your browserâ€™s or appsâ€™ cookies** regularly since some marketers may use the third-party cookies to track your movement online.
3. **Use a password manager** rather than using the auto-fill feature of your browser. (You can use **[Dashlane](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to store and fill passwords and personal information.)
4. **Lock your computerâ€™s screen** before you leave your seat in a public place, like coffee shops.
