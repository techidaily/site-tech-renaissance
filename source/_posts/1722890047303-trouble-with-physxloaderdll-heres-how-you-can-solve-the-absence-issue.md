## How to Fix Physxloader.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Do not download the physxloader.dll file from a "DLL download" website. There are several reasons why[downloading a DLL file that way is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) .

1. [Download the PhysX System Software from NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/physx/physx-9-21-0713-driver/) and install it on your PC to replace the missing or corrupted physxloader.dll file. This is the original source of this file, so it's completely safe. Just be sure to[restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) after the installation.  
 Another option, instead of installing it, is to extract its files. After downloading the program through that link, use a program like[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to get all the files out. You'll find physxloader.dll in this folder, after which you can copy it to wherever the error says it's missing from:  
 `\PhysX\files\Common\`

 If the error occurs while playing a particular game, another option is to check the game's installation folder for a version of the PhysX System Software.  
 You may need to [start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Restore the file from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . If you suspect that you've accidentally deleted physxloader.dll, you might be able to restore it from the Recycle Bin, but only if you haven't already emptied it. If so, try using a[data recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .

3. [Run a virus/malware scan](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . The error you're seeing could be related to a virus or even a hostile program masquerading as the real file.
4. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect the error was caused by recent changes made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could be helpful.
5. [Reinstall the program that uses the physxloader.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the software should replace the missing file.  
 Most physxloader.dll issues are caused by problems with the[Steam](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-steam-4177380) client. If reinstalling Steam doesn't fix the problem,[the Steam Community forum has instructions for repairing game files](https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/412446292767270802/) .
6. [Update hardware drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . Update drivers for hardware devices that might be related to physxloader.dll. For example, if you see the "physxloader.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the [drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your [video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .

7. [Roll back your drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) . If the physxloader.dll error began after updating a particular hardware device, roll back the device drivers to an older version.
