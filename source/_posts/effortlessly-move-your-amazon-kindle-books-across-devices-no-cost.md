#### Transfer kindle ebooks to another kindle device?

Many eBook lovers may have a Kindle, and maybe his/her friends and families also have Kindle devices, so there is a question: How to transfer Kindle eBooks from one Kindle Fire or e-ink Kindle to another kindle device? Because of Amazon's account limitation, people can't transfer ebooks between Kindle devices freely.

If you are a regular visitor to our site, you must know a fact: We will always find a way to help solve all kinds of eBook reading problems, no exception with transferring books from one Kindle device to another.

If you want to **transfer eBooks between two Kindle eReaders** (doesn't involve Kindle Fire tablet), or **between Kindle and computer**, please [jump to the easiest method.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Transfer ebooks from an old Kindle to a new Kindle Fire

#### ![kindle to kindle](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle2kindle.jpg)**To transfer downloaded (not purchased) books:**

**Step 1**: Connect your old Kindle to your computer via USB.   
You will find your kindle device as a drive under "My Computer", click it and open the drive.

**Step 2**: There should be multiple folders. Open the folders and drag selected files from the Kindle and drop them into the computer's hard drive, transfer ebooks and other documents from the old Kindle to your computer.

**Step 3**: Connect another Kindle to your computer via USB, then there will be a removable disk displaying in your computer, open it and transfer the documents those files copied from your old Kindle to the new one. For audio books please put them in the Kindle's "Audible" directory, and for normal books please place them in the "Documents" directory.

#### **To transfer purchased books:** 

All your purchased Kindle books are stored in your account's Kindle Cloud, all you need to do is re-register your Amazon account on your new kindle Fire. Go to the reading app, all the books you have ever purchased in Amazon Store will show up on your bookshelf. Just download them!

### Share books between two Kindle devices registered with the same account

**Note of Caution:**

You are allowed to register your Amazon account on several Kindle devices so that your purchased books will be auto-synced across your different kindles. Meanwhile, those already downloaded books still remain in your old Kindle.

For your newly purchased Amazon books, you can still control which device to sync the item to in the Manage Kindle page.

**Step 1**: Register the second Kindle with the same account registered to the first one. Maybe you purchased a Kindle Touch before then get a new Kindle Fire HD, or your friend or family have got another Kindle and you want to share your purchased book to him/her. Never mind, in one word, it is possible to register your account in another Kindle and won't do much harm on your previous Kindle. After successful registration, please go to Amazon official site then navigate to **"Manage Your Content and Devices"** (Formerly "Manage your Kindle"). From "Your Content" you will see all your purchased files.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 2**: Click on "Deliver" button. From the new pop up window, you can see all your registered Kindle devices and apps, which means, although you can't auto-sync your purchased books to your old Kindle device anymore, **you can also manually deliver them to any of your registered device**.

 From the above steps, you have learnt how to transfer contents from an old Kindle device to a new one; and how to register on two Kindle devices with the same account and transfer purchased contents to them.

But what if you are not convenient to share your account with anyone else but only some books? Yes you can lend them out, but you must sacrifice your own 14 reading days, which is not that satisfying.

Therefore you need a method to **share and transfer your books among unlimited Kindle devices**.

### Transfer downloaded / purchased eBooks to other Kindle devices

#### **Transfer downloaded (DRM-free) books to other Kindle devices**:

For DRM free eBooks, you can easily transfer them to other Kindle devices with USB cable freely.

You just need to simply plug your Kindle to computer with the USB cable, then there will be a removable disk, open the disk and find the books you want to transfer to other Kindles, then copy them out to your local drive. Now things have been finished with this Kindle.

Plug another Kindle on your computer and it will be recognised as a removable disk soon. Paste the books you previously copied out to the current Kindle device. For a Kindle Fire (HD) model, make sure to put the DRM-free Kindle books (mostly MOBI) to "Books" folder. Now you can read those books on another Kindle freely.

#### **Transfer purchased Amazon books to other Kindle devices**:

If you do not want to share your account with others, or do not want to lend your books out. You have to remove your Amazon books' DRM to make them sharable.

And all you need is just a professional program to decrypt your Kindle books. Click the buttons below then you can get the best kindle drm removal--[Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/):

![remove Kindle KFX DRM](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/remove-Kindle-kfx-DRM-1.png)

After getting the DRM free Amazon books, you can just transfer them to other Kindles as the above method shows.

Tips: If you want to transfer Amazon Kindle books to non-Kindle devices like iPad, Nook, Sony, and other eReaders which don't accept Mobi format, you need to remove the DRM first then convert those books to ePub format, which are suitable for other eReader devices.

I will recommend you firstly convert your Kindle books to mobi or azw3 format (without drm), then transfer to your another kindle.

 Or, log in with the same account.

 Or, use Kindle Transfer.

Hi,  
 I am wondering if someone can help me. My parents both have kindle's under the same amazon account but each kindle is registered under their name. My mom bought a book but she sent it to my dad's kindle by mistake. She is asking me how to move it to her kindle and I am not sure how to move the book from one registered kindle to another. Would I just log into their amazon account and go to the manage kindle page and manually transfer that book from my dad's kindle to moms?

I am upgrading from an older Kindle with a keyboard Gen2 maybe (About 4 or 5 years old (good working order - will become the wife's.)to the new, cheap one - one below paperwhite. I have copied the documents file from Kindle # 1 to my P.C. Every title has 4 files \*.el, \*.phl, \*.azw3 and \*.apnx 

 The "documents" flder has sub-folders -looks like every author and sometimes more than one folder per author containing 2 types of files - \*.MOBI and \*.apnx

 I assume I can copy the entire "documents" file as is to my kindle # 2? taking both groups of files.

 Please confirm. Hoping to do all this today, tomorrow at the latest.

 Thanks very Much.

4 files, but just one ebook file.  
 You can't read the ebook file on any other devices, it's contains DRM.  
 Why not download the software one this site?  
<http://www.epubor.com>  
 download and install Epubor Ultimate then connect your Kindle device to you PC/Mac, the device will show on the software's right side. 

 Remove the DRM at first, then copy the decrypted files to new devices.

I bought a Kindle Fire HD 7" about a year and a half ago. I loaded it with hundreds of books. I recently bought a second Kindle Fire HD 7" so that I could leave one at work and not have to take it back and forth. I would like to have ALL of my books on the second kindle but I don't want to go through the 10-at-a-time thing in "manage content" on Amazon. Is there a way that I can put all of my books on the second kindle without losing anything from the first kindle?

You have to be computer wiz to be able to follow the instructions, there are pages and pages of installing and deleting apps, and updating software and it's just way too complicated...especially for Macs. Forget it, I'm out. The developers need to seriously simplify this stuff for those of us who are not computer savvy. What a waste of money.

Thank you for using Epubor software and sincerely sorry for the confusion caused. But for now, degrading the kindle app to older version is the best way to remove kindle drm. Also, the newly updated Epubor ultimate will achieve the process automation (degrading kindle app). So only one click to degrading your Kindle app will be soon added to our software. Please try our software 2 or 3 days later. You do not have to be a computer wiz and removing kindle drm will be more easily.

My Aunt forgot her password for her email and we set her up a new email address. She purchased a new Kindle and she wants to transfer her books from her old Kindle. Is this possible with a new email address?

Thank you for asking.  
 1\. Please check her old kindle firmware version. If the version is older than 5.10.2 , please just plug in this device to computer and remove the drm from kindle books download via this kindle. Then transfer the converted kindle books to her new kindle.  
 2\. If the kindle firmware is higher than 5.10.2, Epubor software can not handle them directly. You need to use other methods to download the kindle books: https://www.epubor.com/faq.html#e108

I used the above methods, first through USB transfer and then using the Kindle transfer software and both times the books arrived on the new kindle without covers. Is there any way to fix this?

I received a kindle from a friend who's sister had passed and she was an avid reader like myself. How can I transfer my books to that kindle or vise versa. I currently have a kindle fire and the one I received is a paperwhite and is easier to read outside. What do you suggest I do??

Please download your kindle books to your computer via kindle for pc/mac, and then remove drm with Epubor Ultimate and convert them to mobi or azw3 format. Then transfer these converted books to your kindle paperwhite.

To avoid Amazon ads, I kept my old Kindle in airplane mode and sideloaded all my reading material using USB on my computer. THey are in the /documents directory.  
 I figure I can just copy everything in that /documents folder, which would also maintain the "Collections" folders.  
 But Kindles keep a huge number of small history files on each item. They do not take up a lot of room, but I would still like to skip them in the transfer process.  
 Any labor-saving tips?
