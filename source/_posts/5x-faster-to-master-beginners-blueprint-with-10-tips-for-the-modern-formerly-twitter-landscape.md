## 5X Faster to Master: Beginner's Blueprint with 10 Tips for the Modern 'Formerly Twitter' Landscape

Close 

 Are you new to[ X (formerly Twitter)](https://www.lifewire.com/what-exactly-is-twitter-2483331) ? The popular microblogging platform has been around for years now, but that doesn't mean you missed the boat. With a few essential X tips, you can be a pro tweeter in no time. Here's what you need to know.

##  Decide Whether You Want a Public or Private Profile 

 X is an open and public social network where anyone can see your posts and interact with you. By default, your profile is public. However,[ you can make your X activity private](https://www.lifewire.com/make-your-twitter-profile-private-3486093) so that only people who follow you (which requires your approval first) can interact with you.

##  Observe How Users Interact on X 

 Before you jump into tweeting, consider checking out other user profiles to see how they use X. You can learn a lot by observing other people's behavior and habits. Looking at how other people act on X gives you a good idea of what sort of X etiquette exists.

 Some of the things you can do right away to[ build your X following](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-get-followers-on-twitter-4628136) include:

* Scheduling tweets for maximum exposure.
* Adding visuals to your tweets.
* Tweeting more often.

## Learn How Retweets Work 

 Retweets are a huge part of X and often make certain pieces of content go viral. Retweeting is a way of sharing another user's tweet and is simple to do, but there are a few ways of doing it.

##  Understand How Hashtags Work 

[ Hashtags](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hashtag-on-twitter-3486592) categorize tweets on X and make it easier for users to find posts according to a specific theme (marked by a hashtag). When you use hashtags correctly, you can attract new followers and interactions.

 You can find hashtags for new movies, political causes, news items, and more. Check out the Search tab on X to see what's trending in your area, nationally, or around the world.

##  Tweet When Your Followers Are Most Active 

 Depending on who your X followers are and where they're located in the world, your best tweets may not be visible if you post at a time when your followers aren't paying attention to their feeds.

 You may want to experiment with[ tweeting at different times](https://www.lifewire.com/best-time-of-day-to-tweet-3486090) throughout the day to see what results in the most interaction.

##  Use X From Your Mobile Device

##  Get More Involved With Conversations by Joining an X Chat 

 X can feel lonely if you're only connected to users who tweet once in a while. Joining an X chat or two can be a great way to:

* Interact with other like-minded users in real time.
* Find more users to follow.
* Attract more followers.
* Expand your network.

##  Automatically Tweet Your Newest Blog Posts 

 If you have a blog, use a tool to automatically tweet new posts when you publish a new blog post. This saves you the time and energy of doing it manually. Use[ IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to link your blog to your X account and send new posts to your followers automatically.
