## Enhanced Autofill Feature in ProtonPass: A New Level of Convenience

Proton just introduced two new improvements to its password manager service, Proton Pass. The new updates allow users to autofill online forms and log into the Proton Pass desktop app using biometric authentication.

 The [Proton Pass](https://win11.techidaily.com/bring-back-the-dormant-wastebin-icon-in-windows/) app across all platforms now has “identities.” This new feature lets you save and autofill the info you enter in online forms. The identities are secured inside an encrypted vault, just like passwords. A Proton Pass Identity can have personal info like names, addresses, organization, or zip codes. After that, a single tap is enough to automatically fill out a form.

 A small adjacent update for item storage was also rolled out. Before the update, Proton Pass could only save notes or credit card info inside its encrypted vault. The same vault can now hold contact numbers, sensitive ID (passport or driver’s license), links, online handles, and email addresses. Proton says, “this comprehensive storage simplifies the management of personal information across various platforms, ensuring all your details are securely accessible in one place.”

 Proton isn’t the first to introduce Identities or item storage, but it is a long-awaited feature which many [mainstream password managers](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-create-facebook-video-ads-with-free-video-creation-kit-for-2024/) already offer. With the payment info, the personal identity, and login credentials all autofilled with a tap, you can breeze through a shopping form in seconds. You’re also less likely to mistype anything with an autofill. Plus, it’s all kept safe inside an encrypted vault.

 The second feature also helps save time. The Proton Pass app on Android and iPhone supports biometric authentication, meaning you can use your fingerprint or FaceID to instantly log into the app. On the Mac and Windows versions of Proton Pass, you had to manually enter your Proton password to log in every time. With the new update, Proton Pass desktop offers biometric unlocking.

[Windows Hello](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-capturing-brilliance-essential-angles-in-iphone-photography/) on Windows and TouchID on Mac unlock the Proton Pass. Biometric login can be enabled with a single click in the Proton Pass settings menu. You have to be on the premium Proton Plus account to use the biometric login though. The Identities feature is free and available to all users.
