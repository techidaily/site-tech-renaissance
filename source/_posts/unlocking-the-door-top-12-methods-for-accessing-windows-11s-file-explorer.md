[File Explorer](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-facebook-media-extractor-quick-mp3-downloads/) is an essential file management application. Whether your [mouse is broken](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/enhance-digital-marketing-success-using-advanced-cookiebot-technology-solutions/) or you just prefer using Command Prompt, there are many ways you can open File Explorer in Windows 10.

##  Click the Taskbar Icon

[Windows PCs](https://www.reviewgeek.com/53358/the-best-cheap-windows-laptops-that-dont-suck/) come with certain apps preloaded on the taskbar, including File Explorer; just click the File Explorer icon in the taskbar to open it.

 If you've removed the File Explorer icon from the taskbar, you can use one of the other methods below to launch it, and then [re-pin it to the taskbar](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-your-essential-guide-to-unmissable-gaming-adventures-for-2024/).

 To do this, launch File Explorer, right-click its icon on the taskbar, and then select "Pin to Taskbar" to keep it there permanently. You can then drag and drop it wherever you want it on the taskbar.
