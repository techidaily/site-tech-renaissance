## Expert Tips for Efficiently Utilizing the Telnet Command Line in Windows OS
### What to Know

* Search**Control Panel** for**features** and then click**Turn Windows features on or off** .
* Next, check the box next to**Telnet Client** , then select**OK** .
* Open Command Prompt and type**telnet** followed by the hostname. For example,**telnet telehack.com** .

 This article describes how to enable Telnet for Windows and how to run Telnet commands.  

## How to Enable the Windows Telnet Client

 Telnet isn't a secure way to communicate with another device, but there are reasons to use it. You can't, however, just open Command Prompt and expect to start executing commands. First, you need to enable Telnet Client through Control Panel.

 These directions apply to Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista. Telnet Client is already installed and ready to use out of the box in Windows XP and Windows 98.

1. [Open Control Panel](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-control-panel-2625782) by searching for it in the Start menu. Or, open the Run dialog box via**WIN** +**R** and then enter**control** .
2. Select**Programs** . If you don't see that because you're viewing the[Control Panel applet](https://www.lifewire.com/control-panel-applet-2625831) icons, choose **Programs and Features** instead, and then skip to Step 4.

3. Select **Programs and Features** .

## Execute Telnet Commands in Windows

 Telnet commands are easy to execute. After[opening Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089) , enter the word**telnet** . The result is a line that says**Microsoft Telnet>** , which is where commands are entered.

![Telnet Client open in Windows 11 Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/730VxbH57Ub5D5pObriOnnCfBmc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/microsoft-telnet-client-windows-11-9e8a181d5b264119b0f67703eb6da069.png)

 Another way to run a Telnet command is to type**telnet** followed by any command, such as the ones shown in the examples below. To connect to a Telnet server, enter a command that follows this[syntax](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-syntax-2626014) :  

 `telnet hostname port`

 For example, entering**telnet textmmode.com 23** connects to textmmode.com on port_23_ using Telnet.

 The last portion of the command is used for the port number but is only necessary to specify if it's not the default port of 23\. For example,**telnet textmmode.com 23** is the same as running the command**telnet textmmode.com** , but not the same as**telnet textmmode.com 95** , which connects to the same server but on port_95_ .

[Microsoft keeps a list of Telnet commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-xp/bb491013%28v=technet.10%29) if you'd like to learn more about how to do things like open and close a Telnet connection, display the Telnet Client settings, and more.

## How Does Telnet Work?

 Telnet is a[network protocol](https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-protocol-network-817949) that provides a[command-line interpreter](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-command-line-interpreter-2625827) to communicate with a device. It's used most often for remote management, but also sometimes for the initial setup for some devices, especially network hardware such as switches and access points.

 Telnet originally was used on terminals. These computers require only a keyboard because everything on the screen displays as text. The terminal provides a way to remotely log on to another device, just as if you were sitting in front of it and using it like any other computer.

 Nowadays, Telnet can be used from a_virtual_ terminal, or a terminal emulator, which is essentially a modern computer that communicates with the same Telnet protocol. One example of this is the Telnet command, available from the Command Prompt in Windows, which uses the Telnet protocol to communicate with a remote device or system.

 Telnet commands can also be executed on other operating systems, such as Linux and macOS, in the same way they're executed in Windows.

 Telnet isn't the same as other TCP/IP protocols like HTTP, which transfers files to and from a server. Instead, the Telnet protocol has you log on to a server as if you were an actual user, then grants you direct control and all the same rights to files and applications as the user that you're logged in as.

 Although not the same as Telnet,[free remote access software tools](https://www.lifewire.com/free-remote-access-software-tools-2625161) are an alternative way to communicate with another computer remotely.

## Telnet Games & Additional Information

 There are several[Command Prompt tricks](https://www.lifewire.com/command-prompt-tricks-and-hacks-2618104) you can perform using Telnet. Some of them are in text form, but you may have fun with them.
