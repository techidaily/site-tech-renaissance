## Top Recommended Samsung Smart TV Applications - Enhance Your Viewing Experience

Hundreds of Samsung apps for Samsung Smart TVs are available, but which are the best must-have apps?

 You get the obvious streaming video apps with Netflix, Vudu, Amazon, and Hulu included on Smart TVs, but there are many other TV apps out there. You might be surprised at what you'll discover among the many apps available. Some apps are quite helpful, such as news, weather, education, and other information, and game apps can be fun.

 Here's a list that will help you decide which ones you want to try.

 Our Top Picks

## The Roku Channel

![Roku Channel Example – Samsung Smart TV](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XCuRBK6nHpBdYPRunf9aw5MDXp8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-roku-channel-samsung-example-1700-zzz-4b576b313fbc448a951648b958e68dbf.jpg)

 What We Like

* 24/7 Live News from ABC and Newsy.
* Live Sports from Stadium.
* Lots of Free Movies and TV Shows.
* New movies and TV shows added weekly.

 What We Don't Like

* Content has Ads.
* Movies and TV shows are not the most current.
* No 4K content.
* May only be available on 2015 and newer Samsung Smart TV models.

 Roku is well-known for its[streaming sticks, boxes, and smart TVs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-roku-4142216) , but it also offers a streaming app for other devices, including select Samsung TVs. The Roku Channel provides a mix of free content accessible through a "Netflix-like" onscreen interface for Samsung TVs that includes live news and sports, as well as past hit movies and TV shows.

## Vimeo

 What We Don't Like

 Everybody watches YouTube, but that isn't the only source of free, original, uploaded video content. Vimeo offers thousands of videos from many sources, including aspiring amateur filmmakers. The best way to get started is by checking out Vimeo's staff picks. Categories include music videos, short documentaries, comedy, and more.

* View online web shows and podcasts.
* Upload your own movies, music, photos, and more.

 PLEX provides a way to organize your content so it can be easily accessed on your Samsung smart TV. This allows you to play any compatible media content stored on your computer on your TV.

You're ready to go once you have the app and media server installed.

 The basic app is free, but you can upgrade to PLEX Premium ($4.99 mo, $39.99 yr, $119.99 lifetime). This lets you watch and record live TV on your computer or in the cloud (antenna and tuner required, as well as the ability to sync your content with compatible mobile devices).

 What We Like

* Built-in rating system.
* Decent selection of free movies to watch.

 What We Don't Like

* Not a huge selection of content.
* Does not support surround sound.
* Available only in the US, Canada, and Europe.

 If you spend much time on Facebook and love watching user-uploaded videos and live news feeds,[Facebook Watch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facebook-watch-4175805) may be the app to check out.
