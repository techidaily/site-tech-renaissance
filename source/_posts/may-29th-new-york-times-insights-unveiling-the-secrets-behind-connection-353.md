 Connections is a game from the New York Times that challenges you to find the association between words. It sounds easy, but it isn't—Connections categories can be almost anything, and they're usually quite specific. If you need a hand getting the answers, we've got you covered.

##  What Is Connections?

 Connections is a game from the New York Times. The objective is simple: sort 16 words into groups of 4\. Each group of words will be connected by some common idea or theme. That common element could be anything. We have seen everything from games that rely on the number of letters in the words to categories that require you to spot an extra letter at the end of the word. Sometimes they're references to economics, other times they reference fairy tales. There is no telling what sort of association there will be between words.

 Once you're confident you understand the connection, select 4 words, then hit "Submit." You have only four attempts in total, so don't be too guess-happy.

##  Hints for Today's Connections Groups

 Here are a few hints for the 353rd Connections game to get you started:

* **Yellow:** The "opposite" of a drink.
* **Green:** To push people to go where you want.
* **Blue:** The subtle threat of violence to
* **Purple:** Bear would also go before this word.

* **Yellow:** Food.
* **Green:** Pilot.
* **Blue:** Intimidate.
* **Purple:** \_\_\_ Market.

##  How Did We Solve This Connections Game?

 May 29th was a pretty average game. The first word I looked at was chow, which is a common slang term for "Food". From there, the words eats, fare, and grub were relatively straight forward connections. They made up the Yellow group.

 Daunt and bully are words that can mean "intimidate." Rattle is a related idea, though it is usually used to describe the after effects of being intimidated. The last word was a bit harder to pick out. Cow, bull, and steer are all terms used to describe bovines, but bull is too close to bully, and steer isn't relatable to bully. That left cow, which can also mean "to intimidate" when used as a verb. Bully, cow, daunt, and rattle were in the Blue group, "Intimidate."

 Direct, guide, and lead are all synonyms that mean to move someone (or something) in a specific direction. Steer shares that meaning, though it is usually used in a very literal sense. They belonged to the Green group, which was "Pilot."

 That left bull, flea, meat, and stock in Purple. In this case, the connection was a word omitted from the ending. Purple was "\_\_\_ Market."

##  How Do You Guess Connections Groups?

 There is no quick, reliable way to approach Connections like there is with Wordle, since Connections isn't algorithmic. However, there are a few things to keep in mind that can help.

1. **Look for similar parts of speech**. Are some words verbs and others nouns? Are some adjectives? Try mentally grouping them based on those categories and see if any other patterns jump out at you.
2. **Are the words synonyms?** Sometimes categories will just be synonyms for a phrase, or very close to synonyms. Don't rely too closely on this, though. Occasionally, Connections will deliberately throw in words that are _sometimes_ synonyms to mislead you.
3. **Try saying the words.** Sometimes, saying the words helps. One puzzle we saw included the words go, rate, faster, clip, pace, speed, move, commute, and hurry—all of which are obviously related to the idea of motion. However, when you say them, it becomes a little more obvious that only four (go, move, hurry, faster) are things you'd actually say to prompt someone to get moving.
4. **Expect the [red herring](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/red%20herring).** Connections usually has words that could be plausibly, yet incorrectly, grouped together. Take the words Bud, Corona, and Light, as an example. You might instinctively see those three words together and assume they're lumped together in a category related to beer—but they weren't.
5. **Look for distinct words.** If a word on your board doesn't have multiple meanings or can really only be used in one context, try using that word as the basis for a category.
6. **Shuffle the board.** Sometimes, moving words around will help you look at them in new ways.

 If you didn't solve this one, don't feel too bad—there's always tomorrow! And those words may align with a topic you're interested in, giving you a leg up on the competition.
