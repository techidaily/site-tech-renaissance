## Ultimate Trick: Tailoring Your Inbox by Building Advanced Rules in Gmail
### What to Know

* Run an email search and then select the**search options** button. Define the search criteria, then select**Create filter** .
* To make a rule based on a specific email, open it and go to**three dots** \>**Filter messages like these** .
* To manage your Gmail filters, select the**gear icon** \>**See all settings** \>**Filters and Blocked Addresses** .

 This article explains how to set up and manage email filters on the Gmail website (the app doesn't support email filtering).  

## How to Create a Gmail Rule From a Search

 Gmail's search tool is quite powerful, so it's a great place to start if you want to filter emails.

1. Use the search bar at the top of the screen to search for the mail you want to filter.
2. Press the**search options** button to the right of the search box.  
![Search results on the Gmail website](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oidnVze07sEZ4BeLK-DQapDOi6k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gmail-search-14d03bab233640a9ab5e6a723a12e1a4.png)
3. Define one or more criteria for the new rule. These are your options:  
   * **From** : Find emails from one or more specific senders  
   * **To** : Find emails sent to one or more specific recipients  
   * **Subject** : Specify partial or complete text in the message subject line  
   * **Has the words** : Find messages that have specific words somewhere in the email  
   * **Doesn't have** : Find messages based on specific words that are not found in the email  
   * **Size** : Find emails greater than or less than a specific size  
   * **Date within** : Find emails sent within a certain period  
   * **Search** : Find messages in a specific area of your email account  
   * **Has attachment** : Apply the rule only to messages that have files attached  
   * **Don't include chats** : Apply the rule to emails only; not to chat conversations  
 This step is essential, so don't overlook it. It explains what Gmail should look for when it runs the filter.
4. Choose**Create filter** .  
![The search options panel open on the Gmail website](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SibK8-GSq_QhkLooWlYe60XUKZM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gmail-search-with-attachment-76a4ccae198d4d498d53b47fe7a19b6e.png)  
 Select**Search** to see the messages that meet the rule criteria. This is a good way to test what the filter will grab.
5. Select the check box next to the options that specify the behavior you want to apply to this rule. For example,**Skip the Inbox (Archive it)** will[archive the messages](https://www.lifewire.com/gmail-archived-mail-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it-4165946) .  
![Skip the inbox (Archive it) option in Gmail](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ktWER261A7_PEGBgYemh10W6nls=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_create-rules-in-gmail-4172416-3493f1c4c3f54a0aa26ddf60cd542a10.jpg)  
 Optionally choose**Also apply filter to \[#\] matching conversations** if you want existing emails to be pulled into this rule, too, and not just new messages.
6. Select**Create filter** to activate the new rule.

## How to Create a Gmail Rule From an Existing Email

 Follow these steps if you want to filter Gmail messages by a particular sender and you already have an email from them. This will speed up the process a little bit. Here's how it works:

1. Open the email and select the**three dots** from the menu above the message.
2. Choose**Filter messages like these** .  
![The 'Filter messages like these' option in Gmail](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9ePhxyfvZRvVtoCC1GQHcaLyBR4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gmail-filter-messages-5f2e5f60cc134f12b05d60ad36c078d6.png)

 Some options, like the**From** field, may be pre-populated with details from the selected message. We've seen strange characters show up here, so be sure to double-check that the information is correct for your specific filter.
4. Select**Create filter** .

5. Pick one or more actions the filter should take. In our example, we're having Gmail auto-delete messages that match the filter, so we've picked**Delete it** .
