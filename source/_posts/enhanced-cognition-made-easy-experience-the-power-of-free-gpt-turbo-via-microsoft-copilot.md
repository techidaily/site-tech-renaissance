## Enhanced Cognition Made Easy: Experience the Power of Free GPT-Turbo via Microsoft Copilot

ChatGPT still uses the older GPT-3.5 language model for free users, even as Microsoft Copilot has used versions of GPT-4 for months. Now, Copilot has been updated to the latest GPT-4 Turbo model for both free accounts and paying Copilot Pro subscribers.

 OpenAI released the GPT-4 Turbo language model [back in November](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-going-against-the-tide-of-tradition-innovative-techniques-for-yt-rewinds/), with more recent training data, a larger 128k context window, and other performance and reliability improvements. The newer training data wasn’t as important for Copilot, since it can search the web with Bing for more information, but the other improvements can be helpful.

 Mikhail Parakhin from Microsoft has confirmed that GPT-4 Turbo is now powering Copilot for free users, after previously being exclusive to [Copilot Pro](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-photoshop-facebackground-anonymity-guide/) subscribers. Microsoft was testing GPT-4 Turbo with free users for a while, mostly before the Pro subscription was announced, but now it’s official. The newer GPT-4 Turbo model is used for the “Creative” and “Precise” conversation styles, but the “Balanced” mode may still use GPT-3.5 for simple tasks.

 Copilot is now the best way to use the GPT-4 language model for free, since ChatGPT still limits free users to the less-powerful GPT-3.5 model. The ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 per month in the United States (the same as Copilot Pro), gives you access to GPT-4 Turbo, faster responses, plugins, the ability to [make and use custom GPTs](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-realme-gt-neo-5-se-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), and other functionality.

 Microsoft has been rolling out other improvements to Copilot over the past month. It can [now be set as the default voice assistant](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-get-hd-quality-quickly-enable-av1-in-youtube-settings/) on Android phones and tablets (just like the ChatGPT app), and the Windows version is [getting drag-and-drop support for files](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-the-art-of-ignoring-ig-suggestions/) and a larger side pane. The company also started rolling it out to [the mobile versions of Word, PowerPoint, and Excel](https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/become-an-instant-contributor-at-a-tiktok-gathering/), but that feature is limited to corporate-managed Microsoft accounts for now. Earlier this week, Microsoft started testing [a detached window mode](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/03/13/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26080-canary-and-dev-channels/) for Windows Copilot.

 You can use Microsoft Copilot from [the desktop web app](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), the Copilot button in Windows 10 and Windows 11, the Copilot button in Microsoft Edge, and other places in Microsoft’s apps and services.
