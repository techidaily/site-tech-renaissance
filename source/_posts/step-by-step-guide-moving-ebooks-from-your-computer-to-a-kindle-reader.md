Otherwise you cannot remove drm successfully and copy epub to kindle.) 

If you have other formats like PDF, you need to add the books by yourself. Click the "Add" button at the top left corner of the program's interface and choose your books to add to the program. Or you can drag the books to the left part of the program directly. This is easier and faster.When you add the books to the program, their DRM will be removed. There's no need of doing anything else manually.

After removing DRM, you need to convert the non-kindle books' formats to those supported by kindle. Convert to mobi might be the best for reading. The decrypted books are listed in the left part of Ultimate Converter's interface. Set the output as mpbi, choose your decrypted books and click "Convert" button at the bottom right corner. The books will be converted to mobi books within seconds. 

3Copy non-kindle books to kindle 

Connect your kindle to computer using the micro- USB cable. You can transfer files from and to your Kindle just like it was an external hard drive. Double click the kindle drive, then you will see there is a "documents" folder in it. Then copy your converted mobi ebooks to the "documents" folder. Done.
