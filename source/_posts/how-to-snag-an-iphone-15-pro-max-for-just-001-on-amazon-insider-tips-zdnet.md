## IPhone 15 Pro Max at Just a Penny - Exclusive Amazon Offer Explained!

![iPhone 15 Pro in hand](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/00c8ca63cca870f1bf03e388fe1fa1f82bf4b55e/2024/07/29/22839969-5de4-4f2f-ba2b-342d180fcd54/iphone-15-pro-ios18-1-ny.jpg?auto=webp&precrop=1772,996,x129,y156&width=1280)

The "[free phone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-good-is-that-smartphone-deal-use-this-free-spreadsheet-to-do-the-math/)" deal is nothing new, and if you've clicked into this article with a bit of skepticism, that's normal. Such offers are almost always too good to be true, whether promoted by AT&T, T-Mobile, or Best Buy. For the right customer, however, they're the perfect opportunity to own a new phone for less than retail.

The latest variation of the "free phone" comes via Boost Mobile, which is selling [the iPhone 15](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPhone-Pro-Max-trade%2Fdp%2FB0CHBQTL9Z%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C350701c0-c2a9-4371-86fc-b1c0e3d1a1ac%7Cdtp&dtb=1), including the Pro Max, for one cent. What's the deal with this deal? Let me break down the fine print for you.

[iPhone 15 for one cent (save $1,099) View now at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPhone-Pro-Max-trade%2Fdp%2FB0CHBQTL9Z%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C350701c0-c2a9-4371-86fc-b1c0e3d1a1ac%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

Buying one of the [best iPhones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/) on the market for almost no money is a no-brainer for anyone, but digging into the offer details shows that you must meet three other qualifications to reap the benefits:

* You must enroll in a 36-month installment plan under Boost Mobile.
* A Boost Infinite wireless plan is required and starts at $65 per month.
* The iPhone will be locked to the Boost Mobile network and will be unusable by other carriers.

Basically, the one-cent iPhone is Boost Mobile's way of reeling you into a three-year agreement. The wireless plan that you have to sign up for is how the carrier makes its money back. 

**Also: [iPhone 15 Pro review: Coming from iPhone 12 Pro or earlier? This upgrade will wow you](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-review/)**

If you ever opt out of the contract, you'll have to pay off the rest of the iPhone. Conversely, once you get through the three-year term, you can always resell the iPhone and get some money back.

These qualifications shouldn't surprise you, especially if you've purchased a phone from a carrier before. In fact, if you're already under a monthly data plan that costs roughly the same (if not more), your existing handset has been paid off, and you're ready to try a new (and possibly better) mobile service, this deal is not as bad as it seems. Best of all, you don't have to trade in any qualifying devices.

Before you [take the offer,](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPhone-Pro-Max-trade%2Fdp%2FB0CHBQTL9Z%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C350701c0-c2a9-4371-86fc-b1c0e3d1a1ac%7Cdtp&dtb=1) here are the [key differences](https://www.zdnet.com/article/which-iphone-15-model-should-you-buy-comparing-regular-plus-pro-and-pro-max/) between every iPhone 15 model to help you decide which is best for you:

* iPhone 15: Most standard iPhone 15 experience, with a 6.1-inch display and a slew of pastel colorways
* iPhone 15 Plus: Best battery life iPhone with a big 6.7-inch screen, but has a 60Hz refresh rate panel
* iPhone 15 Pro: Similar feature set as the Pro Max but with a smaller form factor and shorter zoom capabilities
* iPhone 15 Pro Max: Best camera experience thanks to 5x optical zoom and a large AMOLED screen at 120Hz
