##  Galaxy Ring Specs and Features 

 Along with coming in nine sizes (5 to 13), the Galaxy Ring is also available in three colors: Titanium Black, Titanium Silver, and Titanium Gold.

 Samsung says the wearable will have an up to seven-day battery life and fully charge in 80 minutes. The different sizes of rings also have varying sizes of batteries, ranging from an 18 mAh cell in the smallest model to 23.5 mAh in the largest.

 The Galaxy Ring has a charging cradle with its own battery that you can use while traveling. Its capacity is 361 mAh, which means it can provide between 15 and 20 full charges to your ring (depending on its size) before you need to plug it in.

 Samsung aimed to make the Galaxy Ring unobtrusive, so it tops out at 3 grams. You're meant to wear it all the time, so a bulky form factor would be a bad idea.  

 As we observed in the quick looks we'd caught of the Galaxy Ring, it has three sensors: an accelerometer to measure motion; a photoplethysmogram (PPG), which uses light to track heart rate and blood oxygen; and a temperature sensor.

 Samsung's main focus with the device is sleep tracking; the sensors can tell when you move in your sleep, chart your pulse and respiration, and more. Here are some of the metrics Samsung says it'll measure:

* How much you move overnight
* How long it takes you to fall asleep
* Cycle tracking
* Pulse and breathing
* Automatic workout detection

 The Galaxy Ring offers "scores" for both sleep and energy, and it synthesizes all of its raw data through Samsung AI. The AI will give you wellness tips intended to help you sleep better and be more active.

 While we'd heard there might be a subscription for data tracking, The Galaxy Ring feeds into[ Samsung Health](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-health-how-it-works-4172072) , so you can see everything without paying extra.

 Like other wearables, you can also use the Galaxy Ring to do some things on your (compatible) phone. For example, you can use a double-pinch gesture to snooze your alarm or take a picture.
