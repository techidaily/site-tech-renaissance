### Read EPUB & PDF eBooks on Windows 8 

You can get specific software to read epub and pdf ebooks correspondingly which may offer you much nicer reading experience. However, the integrated way is more convenient.

#### **1\. Metro Reader to Read DRM-Free EPUB on Windows 8**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 The epub books here have to be DRM-free ones. For reading epub ebooks on Windows 8, [Metro Reader](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/metro-reader/9nblggh08czx) is the first off-line ebook reader for it. Metro Reader supports epub and txt formats. There are two reading modes provided: the day mode & the night mode. You can choose it as you need. And the snap mode is of course indispensable. The Table of Contents is supported (only for epub books). Besides, CoverFlow and GridView are supported in it. The font size of the content is customizable, so you can change it as you like. When reading your epub books with it, you can set it as the one-page mode or the two-page mode. Very flexible, right? It sells $2.99 now and free trial is available.

#### **2\. Adobe Reader to Read DRM-Free PDF on Windows 8**

For reading pdf ebooks on Windows 8, a nice choice would be [Adobe Reader.](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-US/app/adobe-reader/162a2931-8ee6-4a56-9570-53282525d7a3)It's free in Windows app store, so this can be an advantage of it. There is nothing better than freebies. This software works perfectly with Windows 8 operating system. It opens your pdf files quickly (including password-protected but non-DRM pdfs). This software offers many functions to help users get a better reading experience. For example, you can take notes when you are reading. 

####   **3\. Read DRM EPUB & PDF on Windows 8**

In this part, we mainly discuss about the DRM epub and pdf books. The softwares below of course can read non-DRM epub and pdf as well.

**Method 1\. Use different softwares to read ebooks in different DRM.**

Use Adobe Digital Editions to read Adobe DRM epub and pdf books. The latest version of Adobe Digital Editions are not available for Windows 8 and the ADE 2.0 requires .Net 3.5 on your computer. However, it's said a previous Adobe Digital Editions 1.7 can be installed on Windows 8\. You can[click here to download ADE 1.7.](http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/403/kb403051/attachments/setup.exe) If successfully install it, you can use it to read Adobe DRM books. 

Use [Nook for win 8](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/nook-books-magazines-newspapers/05dbbb07-cd42-4a5f-9cd3-a329d52bd372) to read Nook DRM ebooks. 

The method 2 below can help you enjoy your ebooks better.

**Method 2\. Remove ebook DRM and then read them on any software you like.**

Most of the ebooks we purchased are locked by DRM. Here I recommend to use a DRM removal for Windows 8—[Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/). It has DRM removing as well as format converting function. You can use it to remove four types of DRM, Adobe DRM, Nook DRM, Kobo DRM and Kindle DRM. After removing DRM, you can read the ebooks freely. If converting formats is needed, it will be easily done with Epubor Ultimate. This is the best way to read ebooks on Windows 8\. Download and install ultimate on your computer.

Download Ultimate for free

[Windows Version Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [Mac Version Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

 Before removing their DRM, you should make sure the epub and pdf books can be opened through ADE successfully (The decryption key is generated in this process. If they cannot be opened, the correct decryption key is not going to be generated. Thus removing DRM later would fail).

Run Epubor Ultimate, it will load your books automatically. Just drag and drop the books to the right column of the program, the books' DRM will be removed at once. If you need to convert formats, just continue to set the output format as you need, and click the big "Convert" button.

Then you can read the ebooks on Windows 8 with your favorite reading software on it. (By the way, now you can also read your ebooks freely on your e-readers if you have one.)

_Friendly message for you_: Don't forget that you can also use this tool to remove Kindle DRM, convert Kindle formats to others such as epub and pdf etc. to read.

[Re:How to Read eBooks on Windows 8](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

Hi,  
 I have been enjoying converting Kindle books to PDF and Epub on my Windows 8.1 and then copying them on my Onyx Boox MaxCarta. 

 But now the Epub books once converted with Epubor Ulimate appear as Wopdpad, and that text is unreadable.

 Recently a Windows panel appeared when I wanted to open de Epub via Epubor, asking me with what I wanted to open it. But none of the offered options was compatible, like Email, Chrome, Wordpad, and a few others. Plus the option to get an app. Not knowing any better I chose Wordpad.

 I wonder how to resolve that, as now I can't read converted Epub books on my ereader.

 Thank you for your kind attention to this,  
 Lode
