* **Gear** \>**Settings** \>**Filters...Addresses** \>**Create...** \> Add the address to**From** \>**Create filter** . Check**Never... Spam** , and press**Create filter.**
* From an email: Open the message, and press**More** . Select**Filter...like this** \>**Create filter** . Check**Never... Spam** , and press**Create filter.**

 This article explains how to create a filter in Gmail to always allow emails from a certain sender or domain, either from scratch or using an existing message similar to the ones you want to allow.

## Start With Filters and Blocked Addresses

 The way to mark a specific email address or domain as allowed is to make an email filter.

1. Open Gmail. In the upper-right corner, select the**Settings** (gear) icon. From the menu, choose**Settings** .

2. Select**Filters and Blocked Addresses** .

3. Select**Create a new filter** . If you already have many filters, you'll have to scroll down to find this link.

4. A dialog box appears. In the**From** field, type the email address you want to allow. Be sure to type the full email address, like**<example@yahoo.com>** . To allow every email address from a particular domain, type just that domain name, like**@yahoo.com** .

5. At the bottom of the dialog box, select**Create filter.**
6. On the next screen, tell Gmail what to do with the email address or domain you just indicated. To do so, select**Never send it to Spam** . To finish the process, select**Create filter** .

7. If you want to allow more than one email address or domain, you need not repeat these steps for each one. Instead, put a vertical bar (and a space before and after it) between the separate accounts, as follows:**<person1@example.com>** |**<person2@anotherexample.com>** |**@example2.com** .

## Start With an Email Message

 You can also start the process of making an email filter in Gmail from a message from the person you want to add to the allowed list.

1. Open the message.
2. In the upper-right corner of the message, select the**three-dot** (menu) icon. Select**Filter messages like this** .

3. With the email address now auto-filled for you in the**From** field, follow steps 5 and 6 above.

## Additional Gmail Filtering Tips

 When creating filters in Gmail, keep these additional points in mind.

* When you add an email address or domain in Gmail, the filter doesn't apply to messages already received. It works from the time you enable it onward.
* If you're considering allowing an entire domain, think about the possible consequences. For example, if you allow @gmail.com,_every single email_ from a Gmail.com address will be prevented from going to the Spam folder. Yet, there's a good chance that some messages from @gmail.com addresses should indeed go there. It makes more sense to allow a company you do business with when, for whatever reason, messages from individuals at that company tend to end up in your Spam folder.
* Another way to mark emails as not being spam is to use the**Not spam** button. However, this button is only visible when a message is opened from the Spam folder. In other words, you cannot use this method to proactively prevent messages from getting marked as spam.
