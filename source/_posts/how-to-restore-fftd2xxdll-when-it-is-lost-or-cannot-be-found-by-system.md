## How to Restore fFtd2xx.dll When It Is Lost or Cannot Be Found by System
 Ftd2xx.dll errors arise from the removal or corruption of ftd2xx.dll, a[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) that's part of a[device driver](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) from Future Technology Devices International.  

 This file can cause error messages on any of Microsoft's operating systems, including[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) ,[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) ,[Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) , etc.

## How to Fix Ftd2xx.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.  

 Do not download ftd2xx.dll from a "DLL download" website.[Downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore ftd2xx.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" DLL file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If this could be your situation, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you might be able to recover it with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete this step, or any of the following steps, if you're unable to access Windows normally because of the error.
2. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some ftd2xx.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
3. [Reinstall the program that uses the ftd2xx.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling that program should replace the file.  
 Try your best to complete this step. A reinstallation of the software that provides this file, if possible, is a likely solution to the error.
4. [Update the USB device drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . That's what the ftd2xx.dll file is used for.  
 If updating drivers through that link doesn't work, visit the[FTDI](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/) website to download them directly from the source or to contact the developer. There are also[free driver updater tools](https://www.lifewire.com/free-driver-updater-tools-2619206) that could be helpful in this situation.
5. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if the DLL errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
6. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect the error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
7. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many service packs and other patches replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. This DLL file could be included in one of those updates.
8. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . We've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's memory and hard drive are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause DLL errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
9. Use a [free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair ftd2xx.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid registry entries that might be causing the DLL error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners. They're included as an option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
10. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the hard drive and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during this step. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
11. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL issue can only be hardware related.
