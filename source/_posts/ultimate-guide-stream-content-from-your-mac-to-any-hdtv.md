## How Do You Block No Caller ID Calls on an iPhone?

 There are lots of ways to block no caller ID calls on the iPhone. The phone includes some features specifically designed to block these calls and it also gives you some tools you can adapt to this use. You can also get help from your phone company and the national Do Not Call registry.

## Silence Unknown Callers on iPhone

1. In the**Settings** app, tap**Phone** .
2. Tap**Silence Unknown Callers** .
3. Move the**Silence Unknown Callers** slider to on/green. With that done, all calls from numbers not in your address book are automatically silenced and sent to voicemail.

 Most phone companies provide paid services that[block scam calls](https://www.lifewire.com/block-scam-calls-on-iphone-5203199) and telemarketing calls. The iPhone's features should be enough for most people, but if they're not for you, or you want another layer of call screening, contact your phone company. Expect to pay an extra few dollars per month for this service.

1. In the**Settings** app, tap**Focus** .
2. Tap**Do Not Disturb** .
3. Move**Do Not Disturb** slider to on/green.

4. In the**Allowed Notifications** section, tap**People** .
5. In the**Also Allow** section, tap**Calls From** .

 FAQ

* What does "No Caller ID" mean?  
 A caller who shows as "No Caller ID" is hiding their number. They do this to make their calls harder to block or track, especially if they're involved in scams.
* How do I find out who called if they have no caller ID?  
 Because the caller is masking their identity by hiding their number, it's hard to find out exactly who it is. It doesn't really matter, however, because almost every time you see a call like this, the person calling is up to no good. It's best and easiest to take the above steps to block them, or don't answer when you see "No Caller ID."
