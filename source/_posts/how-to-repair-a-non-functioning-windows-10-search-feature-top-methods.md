## Why Search Is Not Working in Windows 10

 It's more common than you might think for the Windows search box to stop working. This means there are several possible causes, like a temporary glitch or an unresolved software bug. Another possible reason Windows search isn't working like you want it to is that a very specific setting has been switched off.

## How to Fix Windows 10 Search Problems

 You'll use a lot of the same methods to fix problems with search as you would other minor errors. Here are some options to try and get the Windows search bar working again:

 In a hurry? We've got a[list of all the best file search tools](https://www.lifewire.com/11-free-file-search-tools-1356644) , some of which are far faster and include more features than Microsoft's.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . It's basic advice, but there's a reason it's the first port of call for most Windows errors—reboots often work wonders. If you haven't tried restarting your device, do so now to flush out the memory and clear away temporary glitches that can make the search bar not work.  
 A quick reboot can also be the[solution to a frozen taskbar](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-windows-10-taskbar-frozen-4585023) . Follow those steps, instead, if you can't search in Windows 10 because the whole taskbar is unresponsive.
2. Run the Windows Search troubleshooter. Microsoft's built-in search troubleshooter is a good option because it walks you through a step-by-step wizard that asks about the problem and then performs automated fix-it steps.  
 Press**Win** +**i** to open Settings, then go to**Update & Security** \>**Troubleshoot** \>**Search and Indexing** \>**Run the troubleshooter** to go through the diagnostics.
3. [Turn Cortana off and on again](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-cortana-in-windows-10-4165920) . Since Cortana is so entwined with the search function, switching this feature off, even temporarily, can fix search-related issues in Windows 10.  
 If this problem is more closely related to Cortana, we have a[list of solutions for fixing problems with Cortana](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-cortana-4151935) .
4. Rebuild the Windows 10 search index.[Open Control Panel](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-control-panel-2625782) and then change the**View by** option (at the top right) to**Large icons** , assuming it isn't set that way already. Then, go to**Indexing Options** \>**Advanced** \>**Rebuild** \>**OK** .  
 To speed up searches, select**Modify** in the Indexing Options window to edit which folders Windows 10 should index.
5. Change the search bar settings to make Windows 10 search through more folders. Complete this step if you think the search box is broken because it's not finding all your files. In reality, Windows Search just needs to be told to look through those folders.  
 Go to**Settings** \>**Search** \>**Searching Windows** . In the**Find My Files** section, click**Enable Enhanced** . Also, take this time to ensure that your important folders aren't listed in the**Excluded Folders** section.
6. Restart the Windows Search service. This service is responsible for indexing and displaying results. The Windows 10 search bar won't work correctly if this service has been shut down or is experiencing a glitch.  
[Open Services](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-4107276) , right-click**Windows Search** in the list and then press either**Start** or**Restart** (whichever one you see). This should fix Windows Search right away if this is the reason it's not working.
7. [Update Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . If this is a known problem, Microsoft might have released a fix for the broken search functionality.
8. [Run System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . This will revert important system files to a previous date, hopefully, one when Windows Search was working.
9. [Reset Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/reset-this-pc-complete-walkthrough-2624538) . This is the last step you should take if the search box in Windows 10 still isn't working because it will delete everything on the computer. An OS reset is ideal here because this problem is fully software-related, but make sure you try all the above first!
