You may have already bought a ton of eBooks from Kobo store, and always were reading them with your iPad or Android, but now you get yourself a new eReader, Kindle Voyage. So you may want to load your kobo books to Kindle device and read them, right?

Do you know how to transfer kobo books to your kindle eReader? Most of ebook lovers don't know how to. The most frequently asked question is :

> How do I transfer epub books from my kobo to kindle device? I dragged them over USB to documents in the kindle, but it appears that kindle won't recognize them!

Yes, if you just drag and drop kobo books to Kindle device, you kindle device will never recognize them. That's because Kobo books are protected by Kobo DRM or Adobe Adept DRM. What's more, most of Kobo books are in epub format. So the DRM limitation and format differences make reading kobo ebooks on kindle device not so easy.

* DRM: kobo books we purchased from Rakuten store may be protected with Adobe Adept drm or Kobo drm.
* Format: kobo books are always with common epub or pdf or kepub formats, while Kindle devices only support their own kindle formats, such as Mobi, AZW3, AZW, PRC, etc.

Since now we have figured out the main reasons, to transfer kobo book to kindle, we just need to fix the incompatible issue mentioned above. Follow the below steps to transfer kobo books to kindle device.

### Transfer Kobo books to Kindle easy with Epubor Kindle Transfer

![transfer kobo books to kindle](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/transfer-kobo-books-to-kindle-with-kindle-transfer.png)

Here I want to share a useful tool [Kindle Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/transfer/) with you. There are different ways to convert kobo books to kindle supported format around there, but Kindle Transfer is definitely the easiest way to transfer Kobo books to Kindle. 

Even though your Kobo books synced via Kobo desktop or Kobo eReader are DRMed, during transmission, this tool will automatically remove DRM from Kobo files and convert them to Kindle supported formats. So amazing, right? Just download it and have a free trial!

[Windows Version Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/transfer/) [Mac Version Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/transfer/) 

#### 1 For Kobo eReader users:

Based on its clean and friendly interface, it's very easy to use. Just connect both Kobo and Kindle to computer. In the left hand panel, you are choosing the eBook source, so we click on the Kobo.

Then tick the books you want to transfer to Kindle, and choose "Kindle" as target, finally click on "Transfer" button. The software will transfer all the ticked books to Kindle and make them readable on Kindle. 

#### 2 For Kobo reading app users:

You just need to install [Kobo desktop reading app](http://www.kobo.com/desktop), sync the books to computer, and point the "Computer" folder to Kobo desktop reading app's content folder. By clicking the pencil icon you can edit the folder path settings.

The Kobo desktop reading app's content folder is:

**For Windows:** _C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Kobo\\Kobo Desktop Edition\\kepub_

**For Mac:** _.../Library/Application Support/Kobo/Kobo Desktop Edition/kepub_

Compared to the steps for Kobo eReader users, you just need to click on "Computer" in the left hand panel to choose computer as eBooks source, the jobs left are exactly the same.

I've listed the steps of transferring kobo books to kindle in summary 

* Download and install [Kindle Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/transfer/) software.

### Another way to transfer kobo books to kindle

Although kindle transfer can help you transfer kobo books to kindle, I also want to offer a different way to convert kobo to kindle in case you cannot find your kindle at your hand. 

Step 1 Sync kobo books to your computer via Kobo for PC/Mac.

Step 2 Download and install [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)\--the best kindle drm removal and ebook format converter. With it, you can convert kobo to kindle supported format with just 1 click. 

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

Step 3  Launch Epubor Ultimate, and find the kobo book in the left column under "Kobo" tab. Drag and drop the kobo books to the right column to decrypt them.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 4  Select "AZW3" as the output format, then click on "convert to azw3" button to start the conversion.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Once the conversion is finished, you can click " Succeeded" to show the converted kobo books.

Step 5  Connect kindle to your computer with USB cable, and then copy and paste the converted kobo books to the "Document" folder of your kindle device. 

Now you can read your kobo books on your kindle device.

Hi Ada,  
 My Kobo broke while on holiday and I was given a Kindle as a birthday gift to replace it.  
 Is there any way I can get my Kobo books onto my Kindle as I cannot connect the broken Kobo?  
 Thanks.

Hi Pat,   
 It won't be a problem, and there are two ways to transfer Kobo books to Kindle without Kobo eReader.

 One is download books from Kobo website, and in this case, you also need dowoload Adobe Digital editions to receive the book,the next step is easy, strip the DRM and convert Kobo books to Kindle foramt with Epubor Ultimate.

 Another method is download Kobo Desktop reading app and sync books to your computer, and then do the same thing as method 1.

 You can read this guide for more details, <http://www.epubor.com/how-to-read-kobo-books-on-kindle.html>

Hi, I'm confused. I'm wanting to transfer my purchased kobo books to a new kindle paper white, so bought the KindleTransfer software, but when I try and transfer a book all I get is a spinning circle on "status". I thought the kindle transfer software was supposed to handle DRM Kobo books - thats what this post says.

 In the reply to Pat though, you are now saying to use a completely different piece of software, epubor ultimate, AND install adobe digital editions, and go through a process to strip DRM.

 Does kindle transfer actually work? Did I buy the wrong thing?

I had trouble getting the app to recognise my devices at first, but after some fiddling around I discovered why. It seems like the app isn't able to identify the devices (even though they were showing up in the Device/Drive of my PC) when they were plugged into a USB 3.0 port. Changed them to USB 2.0 and the app suddenly found them and I was able to make the transfer without any problems from then on. Hope this helps some people.

Kindle Transfer can help you transfer Kindle books to Kobo or another Kindle device. But if you want to download Kindle books to your mobile devices, we suggest you use Epubor Ultimate software instead, which can also help you download kindle books to Kobo device as well.

This would be a brilliant system if it actually worked. I downloaded the trial version and it doesn't recognize my kindle fire 7 no matter which port I try. I have also tried on my Dads computer and it doesn't work on his either.

This app worked so well. My kobo is too old to be recognized by the program (Kobo has stopped supporting it, hence the switch to kindle), but I used the kobo desktop reading app and it worked perfectly, locating all of the books on my computer that I had downloaded and transferring them tony kindle with the click of a button. My one issue is that there are a few books who's cover art didn't come across, so when I look at them on the kindle they all look the same, I can't tell which is which without opening it. Is there a fix for that? most worked, there are just a handful that did not. Thanks for this awesome tool!

Thank you for using Kindle transfer. To fix your problem, when you have transferred the kobo books to your kobo, please add .kepub before .EPUB. When have you changed your book title like BOOKTITLE.kepub.epub, the book cover will be displayed at your Kobo device

[Re:Transfer Kobo Books to Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

I purchased this software yesterday to move my Kobo library to a new Kindle paperwhite. When trying to transfer it does nothing. When viewing my Kindle library it mentions that my firmware is to new and to use an older version of the Kindle PC app. I downloaded it from your site and installed making sure update was turned off. I still have the same problem. This is marketed as easy to use but there is zero ways to know what I need to and I am at the point of asking for a refund.

Is there any way I can convert the other way round, from Kindle to Kobo?
