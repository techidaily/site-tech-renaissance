![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-26_14-37-19.jpg)

 Many users reported the issue that their AMD graphics cards are not showing up in Device Manager. It’s a common issue but it doesn’t necessarily mean your hardware is broken. If you encounter this error, here are some quick fixes you can try.

## Try these fixes…

 You don’t have to try them all, just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick!

[2: Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[3: Check for the latest Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[4: Restore BIOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Before we dive into anything advanced, please make sure you’ve tried to reboot your PC. Sometimes a simple restart can solve many random computer issues.

## Fix 1: Show hidden devices in Device Manager

 The first thing you can check is to see if your AMD graphics card is listed as a hidden device in Device Manager. If it’s just hidden, you can simply enable it in Device Manager. Here’s how:

1. Right-click the**Start button** and click**Device Manager** .

2. Click**View** , then select**Show hidden devices** .

3. You can check if your AMD graphics card shows up under the Display adapters section.

If this doesn’t work for you, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 A corrupted or outdated graphics driver may cause the graphic card to disappear in the Device Manager. You may need to update your graphics driver to solve this issue.

 Normally you can find the exact driver for your graphics card on the AMD website and install it via Device Manager. As your AMD graphics card doesn’t show up in Device Manager now, you’ll need to use either the AMD Radeon software or a third-party tool.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics card driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

## Fix 3: Check for the latest Windows updates

 It’s important to keep your system up-to-date. According to many users’ reports, we’ve found that installing the latest Windows updates may solve this issue. Meanwhile, some users also mentioned that they encountered this error after they updated their OS, and rolling back the update solved the issue for them.

 In both cases, you’ll need to check for the latest Windows updates and decide if you need an update or a rollback. Below are the steps to install and uninstall Windows updates:

 You may be prompted to restart your PC during the following process. Make sure you save your work and important files in advance.

#### Install the latest Windows updates
