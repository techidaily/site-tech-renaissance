## Unlocking Easy Access with Android Quick Settings Tips and Tricks
### What to Know

* Access Quick Settings: From the status bar,**swipe down** the screen. Swipe again for more options.
* Edit the menu: Tap the**pencil** icon. Long-press and drag icons to move them around.
* You can access some toggles, like the flashlight, directly from the lock screen.

 The Android Quick Settings menu has been a powerful feature of Android since[Android Jellybean](https://www.lifewire.com/android-versions-4173277) . This article explains how to use it. The tips and information below should apply no matter who made your phone: Samsung, Google, Huawei, Xiaomi, or others.

## Get a Full or Abbreviated Quick Settings Tray

 Finding the Quick Settings menu is simple: Drag your finger from the top of the screen downward. If your phone is unlocked, you'll see an abbreviated menu that you can use as-is or drag down once more to see an expanded tray with more options.

 The defaults available may vary slightly between phones. In addition, the apps you install on your phone may also have Quick Settings tiles that appear here. If you don't like the order or your options, you can change them. We'll get to that soon.

## Use Quick Settings From the Lock Screen

 You don't need to unlock your phone to reach this menu, but not all the Quick Settings are available from the lock screen. You can turn on the flashlight or put your phone into Airplane Mode, among other things, but if you try to use a toggle that might give a user access to your data, you'll be prompted to unlock your phone before proceeding.

![Android lock screen with Quick Settings open](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/obGd6L9sRNMrdDVHebdfD1X0xtw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/android-quick-settings-b54fe7996f60451388bd899004b045a6.png)

## Edit Your Quick Settings Menu

 Don't like your options? Edit them. To do this, first unlock your device so you're on the Home screen, then follow these steps:

1. Drag down from the abbreviated menu to the fully expanded tray.
2. Tap the**pencil** icon to open the menu for editing. It's at the top on some phones and the bottom on others.  
![Android settings.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DNQXQl8DV9_spK1AJz-9xRDfDOQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001-how-to-use-the-quick-settings-menu-on-android-88162a616fe74310a63af73af1cf4d35.jpg)
3. Long-press a tile and drag it elsewhere to make changes.

4. Drag tiles into the tray (the top portion of the edit menu) if you want to see them, or out of the tray (the bottom) if you do not.  
 You can also change the order of where Quick Settings tiles appear. The first six items will show up in the abbreviated Quick Settings menu.  
 You may have more available choices than you think. Swipe up to check.

## What You Can Do With the Android Quick Settings Menu

 Now let's look at some of the Quick Settings tiles and what they do. Different phones and operating systems might use different names for these tiles, but most should be similar.

### Internet

 The**Internet** toggle shows you information about the[Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430) network you're using (if any). To see more information about it, or to pick a different network to connect to, just tap the toggle once. In there is also a little bit of detail about the cellular network you're on, which you can toggle off if you want to disconnect from the mobile network.

### Battery Saver

 The**Battery saver** tile toggles[Battery saver mode](https://www.lifewire.com/battery-saver-mode-on-android-5176451) on and off. When on, this will help your phone last longer between charges because it can limit background activity and pause non-essential apps and notifications.

![Android quick settings battery](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DU5oQiA1Yz7ADqOjliT8ZVJBz8Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002-how-to-use-the-quick-settings-menu-on-android-225186c4f3e44acbb14aff3b70d4775e.jpg)

 On some devices, if you tap this tile while your phone isn't charging, you'll see an estimate of how much time is remaining on your battery.

### Flashlight

 The**Flashlight** Quick Settings toggle is the easiest way to[turn on your phone's flashlight](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-on-flashlight-android-phone-7109609) . There's no deeper option here.

### Auto-rotate

 Control whether or not your phone displays horizontally when you rotate it horizontally. You can use this as a quick toggle to prevent the phone from auto-rotating when you're reading in bed, for example. Keep in mind that the Home menu is locked in place regardless of the state of this tile.

This is also known as tethering. Some carriers charge you for this feature, so use it with care.

### Color Inversion

 This tile inverts all the colors on your screen and in all apps. Some people find their screen easier to read when**Color Inversion** is activated.

![Color inversion toggle highlighted on a Pixel phone](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/d44Uw0vuCluK0QbwsyD0_0orByE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/color-inversion-quick-settings-android-9a9022b2cd2244d6b2482eea398de2eb.png)

### Data Saver

**Data Saver** attempts to save on your data usage by turning off a lot of apps that use background data connections. Use this if you have a limited bandwidth cellular data plan. Long-press this toggle if you want to modify which apps should bypass this feature.

![Android quick settings data saver](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8HDS4Nz_7P2gMzgtp7qOXupFEZw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/015-how-to-use-the-quick-settings-menu-on-android-dbdd5ec2d0294e1591082cfb3ddadc05.jpg)

### NFC

 The**NFC** tile was added by Android 7.1.1 (Nougat) although it was not added to the default Quick Settings tray. It allows you to share information between an app on two nearby phones—essentially a social sharing feature. You need an app that takes advantage of the Nearby feature in order for this tile to work. Example apps include Trello and Pocket Casts.
