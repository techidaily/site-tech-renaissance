## [Best Color Palette Creator: Sherwin Williams' ColorSnap Visualizer](https://www.sherwin-williams.com/homeowners/color/color-tools/colorsnap-mobile)

![Screenshots of ColorSnap app on iPhone.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GudKVOEmAJbqg1QZPewOCj3O-n0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SWApp-5b927fb946e0fb00255b5fd8.png)

Sherwin Williams/Apple

 What We Like

* Create custom color palette.
* Day-and-night lighting feature.
* Calculate how much paint you'll need.

 What We Don't Like

* The amount of paint options is a bit overwhelming.
* Only available for Android.

 This app not only allows you to explore all of Sherwin Williams' paint colors, ColorSnap also gives you the ability to create your own color palette. Choose a color you like and see coordinating colors and similar colors to take it to the next level.

 See the color you chose in living rooms, kitchens, and more, then take your app with you to a store to pick up your paint. Oh, and you won't have to guess how much you need; the app's paint calculator can do the math for you.

 Color My Wall/Apple

 What We Like

* It's quick and easy to test color options.
* Paint manually or use the auto-fill feature.

 What We Don't Like

* Have to maneuver around a lot of ads.
* Not as current or visually appealing as others.

 If you're looking for a bare-bones color picker tool, Paint My Wall is simple and easy to use, though you'll have to skip ads every few color changes to keep going with your work.

 The app allows you to use their image to explore color options or upload your own image to test. Paint with your finger or use the smart fill to fill a wall completely.
