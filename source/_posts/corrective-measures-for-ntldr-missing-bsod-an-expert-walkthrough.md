## Corrective Measures for 'NTLDR Missing' BSOD: An Expert Walkthrough
 This issue applies to the Windows XP operating system, including the Professional and Home Edition versions. Beginning in[Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) , Windows utilizes[BOOTMGR](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-boot-manager-bootmgr-2625813) , not NTLDR. If you receive an "NTLDR is missing" error in[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) , [Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) , etc., especially early in the installation process, try[starting the clean install process](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-a-windows-operating-system-2624925) over again from scratch.

## How to Fix 'NTLDR Is Missing' Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . The error could be a fluke.
2. Check your floppy and optical (CD/DVD/BD) drives for media and disconnect any[external drives](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-external-drive-2625867) . Often times, the "NTLDR is missing" error will appear if your computer is trying to boot to a non-bootable floppy disk, CD/DVD/BD, external hard drive, or flash drive.  
 If you find that this is the cause of your problem and it's happening a lot, consider[changing the boot order in BIOS](https://www.lifewire.com/change-the-boot-order-in-bios-2624528) so the hard drive with Windows installed is listed first.
3. Check the hard drive and other drive settings in BIOS to ensure they're correct. The BIOS configuration tells the computer how to use a drive, so incorrect settings can cause problems, including these errors.  
 BIOS usually has an "Auto" setting for the hard drive and optical drive configurations, which is a safe bet if you're not sure what to do.
4. [Restore the NTLDR and ntdetect.com files from the Windows XP CD](https://www.lifewire.com/restore-ntldr-and-ntdetect-com-from-the-windows-cd-2624506) . Restoring these two important system files may do the trick.
5. [Repair or replace the boot.ini file](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-repair-or-replace-boot-ini-in-windows-xp-2624512) . This will prevent the NTLDR error if the cause of the problem is a boot.ini file that isn't configured properly for your Windows installation.
6. [Write a new partition boot sector to the Windows XP system partition](https://www.lifewire.com/write-a-new-partition-boot-sector-to-a-windows-xp-system-partition-2624503) . If the[partition boot sector](https://www.lifewire.com/volume-boot-record-2625818) has become corrupt or isn't properly configured, you might receive the error.
7. [Repair the Windows XP master boot record](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-repair-the-master-boot-record-in-windows-xp-2624513) . NTLDR error messages may also appear if the[master boot record](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-master-boot-record-mbr-2625936) is corrupt.
8. [Reseat all internal data and power cables](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reseat-internal-data-and-power-cables-2624536) . The error messages could be caused by loose or malfunctioning IDE cables.  
 Try replacing the cable if you suspect it might be faulty.
9. [Update your motherboard's BIOS](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-bios-4783238) . Occasionally, an outdated BIOS version can cause the error.
10. [Perform a repair installation of Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-perform-a-windows-xp-repair-install-2624915) . This_should_ replace any missing or corrupt files, but continue troubleshooting if this doesn't resolve the issue.
11. [Perform a clean installation of Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-xp-2624911) . This will completely remove Windows from your computer and install it again from scratch.  
 While this will almost certainly resolve any NTLDR errors, it's a time-consuming process due to the fact that all of your data must be backed up and then later restored. If you can't gain access to your files to back them up, you will lose them all if you continue with a clean installation.
12. [Replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) and then perform a new installation of Windows. If all else has failed, including the clean installation from the last step, you're most likely facing a[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) issue with your hard drive.  
 Windows XP is very outdated. To receive up-to-date security patches, it's recommended that you[install a modern version of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-a-windows-operating-system-2624925) .

![NTLDR is missing error in Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/t6LnkPca14WcwkkG0Adu0kBZRXQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ntldr-missing-error-windows-5af0744d8e1b6e0039e76a88-9abaa4251ee14c3e8782da6e43529966.png)

 There are a few ways the error may present itself, with this first one being the most common:

* **NTLDR is missing**
* **Press any key to restart**
* **NTLDR is missing**
* **Press Ctrl Alt Del to restart**
* **Boot: Couldn't find NTLDR**
* **Please insert another disk**

 The error message displays very shortly after the computer is first started, immediately after the[Power On Self Test (POST)](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-post-2625953) is complete, when Windows has only initially begun to load.

 There are a number of possible causes for[NTLDR](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ntldr-2625949) errors, including the most common "NTLDR is missing" issue.

 The prevailing reason is when your computer is trying to[boot](https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-booting-mean-2625799) from a hard drive or flash drive that isn't properly configured to be booted from. In other words, it's trying to boot from a_non-bootable_ source. This also would apply to media on an optical drive or floppy drive that you're trying to boot from.

 Other possible causes include corrupt and misconfigured files, hard drive and[operating system](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) upgrade issues, corrupt hard drive[sectors](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-sector-2626003) , an outdated[BIOS](https://www.lifewire.com/bios-basic-input-output-system-2625820) , and damaged or loose[IDE cables](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ide-cable-2625908) .
