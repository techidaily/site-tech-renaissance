## Solving the Mystery of a Missing msvcr80.dll: A Step-by-Step Guide
 An msvcr71.dll error happens when the[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) becomes missing, deleted, or corrupted in such a way that the software relying on it can't use the file as it was intended to be used. Seeing that it is missing or not found may cause frustration or confusion, but there are some possible solutions to get rid of that pesky issue. See below some potential solutions for a missing or not found msvcr71.dll and why this happens on your computer.  

 You might see the error message on any Windows program or[operating system](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) that uses the file, like[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) ,[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) ,[Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) , Windows Vista, and[Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) .

## How to Fix Msvcr71.dll Not Found or Missing Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

[Never download DLL files from a website that you don't 100% trust](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . It's important to only use trusted, official sources when downloading files like msvcr71.dll.

1. [Restore msvcr71.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . A missing DLL file could simply mean that you or a program on your computer deleted it, thus sending it to the Recycle Bin.  
 Files you know were in the Recycle Bin at one point, but have since been "permanently" deleted via emptying it, might be able to be recovered with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Starting Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) may be your only option for completing most of these steps if the error is preventing Windows from starting up normally.
2. [Install Microsoft .NET Framework Version 1.1 Redistributable Package](https://web.archive.org/web/20210105073126/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26) to copy the original file to your computer.  
 If the error remains after that get installed, copy the DLL from wherever Windows puts it to the folder your error says it's missing from.  
 That link is to an archive because Microsoft no longer hosts it. If that link doesn't work, there's still a[French version on Microsoft's website](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/download/details.aspx?id=26) that works the same way.
3. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . If you do suspect the errors are somehow related to malicious programs or viruses, running a scan to remove the infection might resolve the DLL problems.
4. [Reinstall the program that uses the msvcr71.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If running a specific program is what prompts you to see the error, then reinstalling it may refresh the file and remove the error.  
 The "official" msvcr71.dll file that Windows (at least, some versions) keeps is located in a subfolder of the**C:\\Windows** directory, so reinstalling the software most likely takes a fresh copy of the DLL file from the folder.
5. Search your computer for a backup of msvcr71.dll. It's possible the program that provided the original file has a second (or even third) copy elsewhere that you can move to the location from where msvcr71.dll is missing.  
 For example, not only does Windows keep a copy in a**\\Windows\\** folder, but so, too, might Microsoft Office and some other programs.  
 Here's one example of a folder you might look in:  
 `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\ADDINS\MSVCR71.DLL`  
 It should be clear where you should copy it from if the DLL error message specifies which folder it's missing from.  
 There are lots of[free file search tools](https://www.lifewire.com/11-free-file-search-tools-1356644) you can use if you don't want to use the built-in search option in Windows.[Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/) is one example.
6. [Edit the Windows registry](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-add-change-delete-registry-keys-values-2625145) if your particular msvcr71.dll error is related to[SQL Developer](https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/) . Follow[these instructions at OracleMAA](https://oraclemaa.com/sql-developer-cant-start-because-msvcr71-dll-is-missing-on-windows/) to make the specific registry edits required to fix this issue.  
 This fix is only appropriate if you're experiencing the "msvcr71.dll is missing" error when opening SQL Developer for the first time after installing it, which seems to be a common problem.
7. [Download the msvcr71.dll file from AddictiveTips](https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/fix-msvcp71-dll-and-msvcr71-dll-missing-error-in-windows-7/) . Yes, we just warned above about downloading DLL files, but AddictiveTips is a website that we trust that provides a clean, unaltered msvcr71.dll file that you can download if your computer is missing it.
8. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If the error persists at this point, you might want to try reverting your computer to a previous time using[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) .  
 This will change lots of important system files back to the state they were in at an earlier date, which may be what you need to do if your error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration.
9. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to msvcr71.dll. Similar to Step 3, if you're receiving a "The file msvcr71.dll is missing" error when doing something specific like playing a 3D video game, for example, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
 This file might have nothing at all to do with video cards; this was just an example to illustrate that you should watch for what's happening at the time of the error to adjust how you troubleshoot the problem.
10. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) . If the errors starting after you updated a specific device driver, then it's likely resolved by removing the driver and reverting to the previously installed one.
11. [Run the sfc /scannow System File Checker command](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161) to replace a missing or corrupt copy of the DLL file. Depending on your version of Windows, the msvcr71.dll file might be supplied by Microsoft, in which case using the[System File Checker](https://www.lifewire.com/sfc-command-system-file-checker-2626020) (SFC) tool could restore it back to a normal state.
12. [Install any outstanding Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . The[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and[patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) supplied through[Windows Update](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-windows-update-2624597) might update or completely replace some of the several dozen Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. It may be the case that the problem msvcr71.dll file is included in one of those updates.
13. [Test the RAM](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . Your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are pretty easy to test, and a failure with one of them may prove to be the culprit of thse DLL errors.  
 You might end up having to replace the memory or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) if any of these tests fail.
14. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) if the steps above still haven't fixed the problem. Doing this should restore all the DLL files back to their working versions as if they haven't been modified or used.
15. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair issues related to this file. Registry cleaning tools can usually solve problems relating to DLL files by removing invalid[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that could be causing the error.
16. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) if none of the steps from above have been able to fix the error. Just as it sounds, a clean install of Windows erases the current installation plus all the files on the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) , and will then install a new, fresh copy of the OS.  
 Please don't skip directly to this step before trying the others from above. This is the most destructive resolution because it removes_everything_ and has you start over from scratch. It should only be carried out if you've had no luck with the prior steps.
17. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if none of the software related steps have proven helpful. At this point, the only possible cause of the errors is a malfunctioning piece of hardware.

## Causes of Msvcr71.dll Not Found or Missing Errors

 A problem with the[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) , a[virus](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-computer-virus-4799053) infection or malicious program installed to the computer, or even an issue with the[computer hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) may be the cause of your errors.

 When issues with this particular DLL file occur, the errors that indicate a problem might be presented as any of the following:

* **Cannot find \[PATH\]\\msvcr71.dll**
* **The file msvcr71.dll is missing.**
* **Cannot start \[APPLICATION\]. A required component is missing: msvcr71.dll. Please install \[APPLICATION\] again.**

 Most error messages like these appear when you try to run a particular program, but might also be seen when installing a particular application, starting or shutting down Windows, or possibly even when installing a fresh version of Windows.
