I love my [Apple Watch Ultra](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Cellular-Titanium-Precision-Extra-Long%2Fdp%2FB0BDHYT2Z8%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C1b5b1a8b-7340-42a6-be8a-331d325a60c7%7Cdtp&dtb=1), and I love being able to have lots of complications on display at any one time. 

Complications for weather conditions, the position of the sun and moon, the phrases of the moon, not to mention a whole bunch of fitness-related complications.

But there's never enough room for all the complications that I need. 

So, in order to satisfy my thirst for complications, I figured out a workaround.

First of all, what is a complication? 

A complication is an element on the watch face that displays information or allows you quick access to an app by tapping on it. 

Complications can be part of Apple's own apps or third-party apps.

Lots of Apple Watch complications.

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

OK, so every Apple Watch face gives you a certain number of slots for complications that you can choose by tapping on the slot (you edit the watch face by pressing on it, tapping **Edit**, and then swiping through the options).

Editing complications on the Apple Watch.

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

But if every Apple Watch face has a certain number of spaces for complications, how do you add more?

Simple, you duplicate the watch face.

Duplicating your watch face allows you to double the number of complications available to you, and you can duplicate the watch face as many times as you want.

**Also:** [**9 ways an Apple Watch can make your life easier**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/9-ways-apple-watch-can-simplify-your-life/)

By duplicating the Apple Watch face, you also don't have to redo all the changes and customizations that you've done on it, making the process straightforward.

But, how do you duplicate your Apple Watch face? Truth is, Apple hasn't made it easy, but it's possible.

Here's how.

## 4\. Edit the complications on your new, duplicate face

This will make a duplicate of the face on your Apple Watch, but you can now customize this with the complications you want.

To access different complications, you can swipe between the faces on your Apple Watch.

I have different faces for photography, fitness, weather, and other interests, and I can quickly and easily swipe between them as my mood or activities change.
