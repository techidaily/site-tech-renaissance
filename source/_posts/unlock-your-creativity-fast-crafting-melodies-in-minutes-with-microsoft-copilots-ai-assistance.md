 Ever dream of wowing your friends with an awesome song, even if you're a musical newbie? Say hello to Suno! It's an AI-powered music plugin for Microsoft Copilot that lets you turn your ideas into full-fledged songs. But how does it work? And how good is it?

##  What Is Suno?

[Suno](https://www.suno.ai/) is an AI-powered music creation tool that lets you craft personalized songs regardless of your musical experience. It's as easy as entering a prompt like "Create a song for my mother" and hitting the "Create" button. Suno will take a short while and then generate a unique song based on your prompt.

 Through Microsoft's partnership with Suno, its music creation features have been integrated into Microsoft Copilot.

 However, the Suno plugin is turned off by default, so you need to manually enable it before you can begin composing.

##  How to Enable Suno in Microsoft Copilot

 To enable the Suno plugin in Microsoft Copilot, visit the [Copilot website](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) and sign in with your [Microsoft account](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-sim-unlock-vivo-y17s-phones-without-code-2-ways-to-remove-android-sim-lock-by-drfone-android/).

 In the top-right corner, click "Plugins."

 And that's it! You can now create songs using prompts in Microsoft Copilot.

##  How to Create Music Using Copilot's Suno Plugin

 To create music using the Suno plugin, type your prompt in Copilot's text field, defining the topic you want Suno to create music about. For example, if you want a song about cats, type "Create a song for my cat" and press Enter.

 Suno will take a few seconds to generate lyrics for the song and give you the option to play it.

 If you like the song, you can save it to your computer. To do this, right-click on the song's thumbnail and choose "Save Audio As."

![Save audio as option to save the song generated by Suno.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/save-audio-as-option.jpg) 

 Select the location where you want to save the song and click "Save."

 You can also share the song on different platforms like Twitter and Facebook. To do this, click the share icon next to the song's thumbnail and choose the platform you want to share it on.

 There are a few things you need to be aware of when using Suno. On the free plan, you can only create ten songs per day, and copyright of the generated songs belongs to Suno. This means that as a free plan user, you cannot monetize the songs on YouTube or any other platform.

![Different subscription plans of Suno.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/subscription-plan.jpg) 

 If you want to generate more songs or monetize them, you can upgrade to the Pro ($10/month) or Premier ($30/month) subscription plan through [Suno's website](https://app.suno.ai/account). The Pro plan allows you to create 500 songs per day, while the Premier plan allows you to create 2,000 songs per day. Both let you use the generated songs for commercial purposes.

##  Is Suno Good at Creating Songs?

 Despite being a free plugin, Suno does a decent job at creating songs, but I noticed a few issues during my tests. First, nearly all the songs Suno generated could generally be defined as rap. Even though I explicitly requested a classic 90s style that wasn't rap, Suno ignored this.

 Another issue is that Suno works well with basic prompts like "Create a song about movies" or "about phones", but struggles with more complex requests like creating songs in specific styles. For example, when I asked Suno to "Create a Dua Lipa-style song about phones," the plugin assured me it could do it with its creative talent, but it would take some time.

 Unfortunately, even after hours of waiting, Suno never delivered the song.

 Additionally, Suno only generates short song snippets. For longer tracks, you'll need to visit the [Suno website](https://app.suno.ai/).

 Suno is great at creating simple songs, but there's still room for improvement. It's certainly not going to make you a rock star, and the songs it creates won't replace your Spotify playlist, but it's a must-try plugin for some light-hearted fun.
