## How did we choose these iPads for kids?

In search of the best iPads for kids, we considered several factors.

* **Screen size:** Older children that work with multiple windows and use their iPad regularly may need a larger screen size than smaller children. Consider which size would be most comfortable for your child's intended use.
* **Age:** Your child's age can affect your decision, too. Some children may be fine with younger screens, but you may find that the smaller screens are not sufficient for your older children. Keep in mind your child's age when choosing the best iPad for kids.
* **Cost:** For the most part, Apple offers set pricing for its products, although we included lower prices when available.
