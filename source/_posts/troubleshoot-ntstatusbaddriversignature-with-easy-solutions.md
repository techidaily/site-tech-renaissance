## Troubleshoot Hulu's RUNUNK13 Issue with These Easy Fixes
 RUNUNK13 is a[Hulu error code](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-hulu-error-codes-3-500-and-more-4173396) that indicates the service is unable to play the movie or show you've requested. When this error occurs, you will usually see a message that looks like this:

* **Error playing video**
* **We encountered an error playing this video. Please try restarting the video or select something else to watch.**
* **Hulu Error Code: RUNUNK13**

## Causes of Hulu Error Code RUNUNK13

 The RUNUNK13 error appears when you try to play a video on Hulu but the player is unable to complete the request. Corrupt data on your end, network connectivity issues, or problems with Hulu's servers can cause the error.

 When trying to play downloaded Hulu content, the episodes or movies may become corrupted.

 In some situations, a problem with the Hulu app or web player itself can make the RUNUNK13 error appear.

## How to Fix Hulu Error Code RUNUNK13

 To fix the RUNUNK13 Hulu error, follow each of these steps in order. If the video starts working at any point, you can stop.

1. Refresh the page, reload the video, or close and reopen the app. Reloading the video is often enough to get rid of this error message.
2. Change the quality option to**Data Saver** . There's a good chance it's currently set to**Best Available** . Some users have fixed the error with this simple change.  
 You'll find this option in the web player through the settings/gear icon at the bottom right. If you're in the mobile app, go to**Profile** \>**Settings** \>**Cellular Data Usage** .
3. Try Hulu on a different device or different web browser to see if the RUNUNK13 error is specific to the ones you're using. If it is, then switch to that web browser or device.  
 If Hulu doesn't work on any of your browsers or devices, this may be a problem you can't fix, so it's best to complete this step early on, before moving forward.
4. Clear your device's cache. Corrupt data stored in the cache can cause this problem, so it's an important step.  
 Purging the cache works differently on every device: web browsers \[[Clear Browser Cache](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clear-cache-2617980) \], Android \[[Clear Android Cache](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-cache-android-4157780) \], iOS \[[Clear iPhone Cache](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-iphone-cache-4178428) \], and Fire TV \[[Clear Fire TV Cache](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-cache-on-firestick-4177638) \].
5. Toggle hardware acceleration on or off in your browser.[It's easy to do in Chrome](https://www.lifewire.com/hardware-acceleration-in-chrome-4125122) if you're seeing the Hulu error there.
6. Restart your device. If you're[rebooting a computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) , make sure it really shuts down and doesn't just go to sleep.  
 Some streaming devices don't have an off switch or restart option, in which case you need to unplug it from power and wait about a minute before plugging it back in.
7. Update your streaming device. Whether it's your TV or a streaming stick that's showing the RUNUNK13 error on Hulu, a pending update could be the fix.  
 If a reboot didn't trigger an operating system update, you'll need to do it manually: Apple TV \[[Update Apple TV](https://www.lifewire.com/update-latest-apple-tv-os-1999697) \], Amazon Fire Stick \[[Update Fire TV Stick](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-amazon-fire-stick-4173448) \], or Chromecast \[[Update Chromecast](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-chromecast-4628168) \].  
 You_could_ update your computer, phone, or tablet, too, but an outdated OS on those devices is less likely to cause this specific Hulu error.
8. Update the Hulu app. There's a chance (albeit small) that this error has been resolved, but you wouldn't know it if Hulu hasn't been updated in a while.  
 If you're on a phone or tablet,[update your Android apps](https://www.lifewire.com/update-apps-on-android-7106106) or[update your iPhone apps](https://www.lifewire.com/ways-to-keep-iphone-apps-to-date-2000645) . If you see the RUNUNK13 error message on your computer,[update Chrome](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-chrome-4690369) or whatever browser you're using.
9. [Fix your slow internet](https://www.lifewire.com/troubleshooting-slow-internet-connection-818125) . A slow internet connection doesn't usually cause this issue, but you might see playback errors like this one if you don't meet the[internet speed requirement to stream video](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-speed-requirements-for-movie-viewing-1847401) .
10. Reinstall the app. Hulu can be deleted and reinstalled on any device that it runs on. On TVs and mobile devices, this is usually accomplished by pressing and holding the app icon; tap the delete or reinstall option there.  
 This step is unnecessary if you're getting the RUNUNK13 error in Chrome or another web browser.
11. [Restart your network hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570) . In some cases, restarting all your network hardware will fix connectivity problems like this one.
12. [See if Hulu is down](https://www.lifewire.com/is-hulu-down-or-is-it-you-4802265) . At this point, it seems likely that the RUNUNK13 error indicates a problem on Hulu's end and not yours. All you can really do is wait for them to fix it.
13. [Contact Hulu](https://help.hulu.com/contact-us/fix-a-problem) . If you still get the Hulu error code RUNUNK13 after following all these suggestions, and you don't see any discussions online about an outage, Hulu might have a more localized issue that you can learn more about by reaching out over online chat or a phone call.
