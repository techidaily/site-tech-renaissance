[Kindle Transfer Won't start](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/transfer/) \-- 6/1/2016 3:44:35 AM 

I installed Kindle Transfer with no problem. When I try to start it I get a message stating "A New Version is Ready. Click "OK" to Confirm Updating, Then Manually Open the Software Again." So I did that and when I restart Kindle Transfer I keep getting the same message. I can't get beyond that message.

[Can Kindle Transfer rip magazines from a kindle device?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/transfer/) \-- 6/6/2020 3:20:21 PM 

Hello :)

 Currently the vast majority of publishers only allow kindle magazine subscriptions to be read on a kindle device and not the pc. Can Kindle Transfer copy the magazines from the kindle device to the pc?

 Warm regards.

Hi, just wanting to test to ensure I can transfer before purchase. Downgraded to Kindle v24, can see books, but Kindle Transfer cannot see my Kobo Libra H20 ereader, so Tranfer button is greyed out.

 Im on a Windows 10 Dell laptop, which can access and sees my ereader as D:, and the ereader is displaying Connected and Charged.
