## Effective Strategies for Locating an Individual's Email
 This article explains how to find email addresses using Google. There are also email search sites and address directories to help you find the information you need.

[Can't recall your own email address? Here's what to do](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-my-email-address-4143261)

## Search for Someone's Email Address Online

 Finding somebody's email address can be difficult. Without an[email domain](https://www.lifewire.com/elements-of-email-address-1166413) name to reference or an organization to classify them in (like_@gmail.com_  or_@company.com_ ), your search instantly becomes extremely broad. If you know their name, however, you can search the internet for any information related to the person, which might help you determine their email address.

 The simplest way to start an internet search to find someone's email address is to type not only their name but any information about them. The goal is to find a resource that groups their identifiable information with their email address.

## Find Email Addresses Within a Certain Website

 This is your best method of finding an email address: Hope they listed it publicly on their social media profile (if they have one). To do this, use Google to search for what you know within a website that you suspect they use.

 Try searches like this:

* **site:twitter.com “_first last_ ”**
* **site:facebook.com “_first last_ ”**

 Replace _first last_ with the name of the person whose email you're looking for, but be sure to keep the quotes around the name to make sure Google looks for that entire phrase. If that doesn't work, drop the first name or last name, but that will broaden the search and make it harder to find who you're looking for.

 Use any website after "site:" so that the search is contained within that website only. If you tried searching for "first last" without using a website like above, you'll get more results than necessary, making it more difficult to find their email address.

## Use an Existing Username

 If you know a username they use on one website, search Google for that same username. The less common the username, the greater the odds that you'll find their profiles (and hopefully email address).

 For example, if they have an X (formerly Twitter) or Facebook profile that uses the “D89username781227” username. Since most people use the same username on multiple platforms, there's a good chance that this will find those other profiles:

* **D89username781227**

 All you do is search for that one username, but if you know their name too, or any of the other information mentioned above, add that to the mix:

* **“_first last_ ”** **D89username781227**

## More Email Search Options

 Think about anything that might be related to this person, but keep it concise. Don't enter whole sentences into Google and expect it to find a web page with all of that information; it likely won't.

 For example, if you know the person's profession (such as a baker), they may have a website that includes that word, which might provide a contact page or an email address. For example:

* **“_first last_ ” baker**

 Combine this with the website-specific search above for more refined search results:

* **site:twitter.com “_first last_ ” baker**

 If you know they have a website, use common words like this:

* **“_first last_ ” baker contact**

 Some websites use the word “contact” in the[URL](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-url-2626035) for the contact page, so a search like this might prove to be beneficial too:

* **“_first last_ ” baker inurl:contact**

 Maybe they have a nickname that you should look for instead. If they have a hobby that you know they made online profiles for, try looking for that word too.

 An address or city name is helpful as well, like this:

* **“_first last_ ” baker Dellwood**

 Since many online records are listed as public records, use that option too:

* **“_first last_ ” inurl:public Dellwood**

 Do you know the email domain they use? If they use Gmail,[Yahoo](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-yahoo-3483209) , or[Outlook](https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-outlook-4164620) , you might have more luck finding the full address if you include those in your search too:

* **“_first last_ ” @gmail.com Dellwood**
