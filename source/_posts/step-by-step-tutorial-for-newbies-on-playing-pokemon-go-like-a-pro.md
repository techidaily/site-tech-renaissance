### What to Know

* Tap your trainer profile and select**Buddy History** to add or swap your_Pok√©mon Go_ buddy.
* Tap your buddy Pok√©mon‚Äôs profile and select**Play** to play with your Pok√©mon.
* Walk with your buddy Pok√©mon to receive gifts, candy, and souvenirs.

 The_Pok√©mon Go_ buddy system is a feature that lets you show off your favorite Pok√©mon, earn candy, and receive in-app gifts and souvenirs. This guide explains how to play together with your buddy in_Pok√©mon Go_ , how to swap Pok√©mon buddies, and how to best use the buddy system to get the most out of the game.

## Adding a ‚ÄòPok√©mon Go‚Äô Buddy for the First Time

_Pok√©mon Go_ added the initial buddy feature back in 2018 and then expanded it significantly in 2019 by letting your buddy appear on the map. The app directed all players through the process of adding a buddy Pok√©mon after each feature update, but if for some reason you managed to bypass these in-app tutorials, you can add your first Pok√©mon buddy by selecting your trainer profile icon from the lower-left corner of the map screen and tapping**Buddy History** or**Buddy** .

 If you don‚Äôt see a**Buddy History** or**Buddy** option, you may need to update the_Pok√©mon Go_ app to its latest version.

## How to Change Your ‚ÄòPok√©mon Go‚Äô Buddy Pok√©mon

 In_Pok√©mon Go_ , you‚Äôre allowed one buddy Pok√©mon at a time and can change this Pok√©mon for another one up to 20 times per day. Here‚Äôs how to swap your buddy Pok√©mon.  

1. From the main map screen, tap your current buddy Pok√©mon‚Äôs icon in the lower-left corner.  
 Alternatively, select your buddy Pok√©mon directly from your trainer profile screen if you already have that open.
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the screen and select**Swap Buddies** .

3. Tap**Yes** .
4. Find the Pok√©mon you want to add as your new buddy and tap it. If successful, the selected Pok√©mon will be shown in a brief fullscreen announcement and then appear on the Pok√©mon buddy screen as your new buddy.

## What Is the Point of Having a Buddy in Pok√©mon Go?

 While having your favorite Pok√©mon appear alongside you on your trainer profile and walk on the map can be cool, there are several more practical benefits to having a buddy Pok√©mon.

* **Collecting Pok√©mon candy** . Your buddy Pok√©mon will earn its own type of candy by walking with you. Walking with a buddy is one of the easiest ways to get candy in_Pok√©mon Go_ .
* **Getting free items in_Pok√©mon Go_**  . Your buddy Pok√©mon will occasionally find items and gifts for you once it joins you on the map and is at its second level, Great Buddy.
* **Collecting souvenirs** . At the third level, Ultra Buddy, your buddy Pok√©mon will occasionally bring you collectibles. Souvenir items have no functionality in the game, but they are fun to collect.
* **Complete challenges** . Some challenges will require you to walk a certain distance with your buddy or get it to a certain level.
* **Pok√©mon evolutions** . A growing number of Pok√©mon,[such as Eevee](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-evolve-eevee-pokemon-go-4689089) , require you to adventure with them as a buddy before you can evolve them. Some need you to fight with them as a buddy, while others may require a certain distance to be walked or items to be collected.
* **The Pok√©mon GO buddy CP Boost** . Once your buddy Pok√©mon reaches its fourth and final friendship level, Best Buddy, it gains a permanent CP Boost, which makes its attacks more powerful in Pok√©mon battles.

 You can completely ignore the Pok√©mon buddy feature if you like, but it is required if you want to 100 percent complete your Pok√©dex and challenges.

## How to Play Together With Your Buddy in 'Pok√©mon Go'

 The Play Together feature in_Pok√©mon Go_ lets you interact with your buddy Pok√©mon by patting it. The feature works much like the similar features in the various mainline Pok√©mon video games on the[Nintendo Switch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-nintendo-switch-4148184) and[3DS consoles](https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-3ds-overview-1126249) . The main difference is that playing with your buddy Pok√©mon in_Pok√©mon Go_ lets you earn hearts, which in turn helps level up your buddy Pok√©mon to higher friendship levels.  

1. From the main map screen, tap your buddy Pok√©mon‚Äôs icon.
2. Tap**Play** .
3. Tap your buddy Pok√©mon to have it react excitedly to you.
4. Drag your finger back and forth to pat it. If you‚Äôre patting your Pok√©mon buddy correctly, you should see sparkles.  
![Pokemon GO with buddy Pokemon and Play icons highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZJo8o9TObp3SUocJtYPzmQ-r3VA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Play-with-buddy-Pokemon-5d81ad40271c49dba320d76c94d2ae10.jpg)
5. After several seconds of patting, a bright light should surround your buddy, and a heart will appear. This heart will go toward your buddy‚Äôs friendship level. You can only earn one heart by playing with your buddy Pok√©mon every day, though you can play with them as many times as you like.
6. Tap the**Exit** icon in the top-left corner to return to the map, or tap the**Berry** icon in the lower-left corner to feed your Pok√©mon berries to get it to appear on the map.
7. To feed your Pok√©mon buddy, tap and drag berries from the lower menu to your Pok√©mon. Three regular Razz, Nanab, or Pinap berries will be enough to have your buddy join you on the map. One Silver Pinap Berry, one Golden Razz Berry, or one Poffin will also do the job.  
 Once your buddy Pok√©mon is on the map with you, the distance required to walk to earn candy is reduced. Your buddy may also direct you to spin certain Pok√©stops to earn hidden prizes and earn bonus hearts.

## Does Swapping Buddies Lose Progress?

 Swapping a_Pok√©mon Go_ buddy for another one will delete any unfinished progress that‚Äôs currently in action, but it won‚Äôt remove any gained friendship level status. For example, if your buddy Pok√©mon is halfway into unlocking a candy, swapping the buddy out will remove this progress. The usual stats that reset at the end of each day will also clear with a swap.

 However, if this buddy has reached Great Buddy or some other friendship level status, that progress will remain no matter how many times you swap the buddy out.

## Does It Matter Who Your Buddy Is in 'Pok√©mon Go'?

 It doesn‚Äôt really matter at all who you choose to have as your_Pok√©mon Go_ buddy. At the end of the day, it comes down to what your particular aims are within the game.

 If all you want is to show off your favorite Pok√©mon on your trainer profile, then that Pok√©mon will be your best buddy choice. However, if you need to get more candy to evolve or level up a Pok√©mon, then adding one of the Pok√©mon that earns that specific candy is the way to go.

 Some_Pok√©mon Go_ players stick with the same buddy Pok√©mon for years on end, much like Ash with Pikachu in the_Pok√©mon_ anime series, while others use the feature more practically to earn candies to evolve a Pok√©mon and then, once that Pok√©mon has evolved, immediately swap it for their next evolution target.

 Many players even use the buddy feature as a kind of fashion accessory. For example, when they change their trainer‚Äôs clothes for Christmas, they also swap out their Pok√©mon buddy for one that has Christmas accessories or a Christmas vibe, such as many of the Ice Type Pok√©mon. Some do the same for Halloween, New Year, Valentine‚Äôs Day, and even a trip to the beach or their birthday.
