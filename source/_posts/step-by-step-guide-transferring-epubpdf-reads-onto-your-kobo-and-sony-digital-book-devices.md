Owners of Kobo and Sony eReaders purchase eBooks from not only official Kobo and Sony eBook stores but also from other sources. Generally, books purchased with the built-in app on the device get synced automatically. But for books purchased from third-party stores, we will have to transfer from computer to the device by hand. 

![Kobo and Sony eReaders](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kobot_main.png) 

This guide will tell you how to add EPUB and PDF books to Kobo and Sony eReaders.

### 1\. How to add EPUB and PDF books to Kobo eReaders

Kobo has released a set of eReader models, including Kobo Touch, Kobo Mini (5-inch), Kobo Glo, Kobo Aura HD, Kobo Forma and two Android tablets (Kobo Vox and Kobo Arc). We can add eBooks to a Kobo eReader with Adobe Digital Editions, Calibre and drag & drop. Because most purchased EPUB and PDF books are Adobe DRM protected, I suggest you use Adobe Digital Editions to transfer books, which authorizes the Kobo device when it is connected to ADE and makes it possible to read Adobe DRM-protected books on Kobo.

**Step1:** Connect your Kobo eReader to computer with the USB cable. Make sure the Kobo device is ready before ADE authorization in Step 2\. 

**Step 2:** Launch Adobe Digital Editions (ADE). If your ADE has been authorized (with your Adobe ID) before, the Kobo device will be detected and a window will pop to tell you to authorize your Kobo. Follow the prompt to finish the authorization. Then you will find a kobo icon shown under "Bookshelves" (LIBRARY view). 

[Download Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/support/digitaleditions/downloads.html) 

**Step 3:** Drag and drop your EPUB or PDF books to the main window of ADE.

![Add EPUB books to Adobe Digital Editions](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kobot_kobo_drag.png)

If it is an ACSM file, double-click the file and the full EPUB book will be downloaded soon. If this doesn't work, you can also drag and drop the ACSM file directly to the main window of ADE. Here is [how to convert ACSM to EPUB](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

**Step4:** Drag & drop your books **from the main window of ADE** to the **Kobo icon on the left side**. The books will be transferred to your Kobo eReader immediately.

![Add EPUB books to Kobo eReader with Adobe Digital Editions](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kobot_kobo_transfer.png)

Eject your Kobo eReader and wait until the finish of sync. Head to "My Books" category on Kobo to enjoy your newly transferred books. 

This method enables users to add both DRM-free books from torrent sites and purchased DRM-protected books from Sony, Google Play and other stores to Kobo Touch, Kobo Mini, Kobo Glo and other kobo eReaders. For DRM-free books, you can also [connect the Kobo eReader to computer using USB and drag & drop to transfer books](http://www.slideshare.net/AdaWyy/add-books-to-kobo-glo-kobo-touch).

### 2\. How to add books to Sony eReader

Books can be transferred to Sony eReader via USB or Sony Reader software. When transferring books with the drag & drop method (via USB), the added EPUB and PDF files might not be displayed. So Sony officially recommends users to transfer books to Sony with Reader Software.

**![Add books to Sony eReader with Sony Reader Library](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kobot_sony_transfer.png)Step 1:** Connect the Sony eReader to computer with the supplied USB cable and the eReader will be in "Data Transfer Mode". Two drives ("SETTING" and "READER") will show on the computer afterwards.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step2:** Go to "SETTING" drive, double-click “Setup Reader for PC” to install eReader software on your PC.

For Mac users, double-click "SETTING" drive on desktop, then double-click “Setup Reader for Mac” to install. 

**Step3:** Launch Reader software and drag your EPUB or PDF books onto the "Library" folder in the left field. 

Eject your Sony eReader, you will find the added books on the device after syncing.

Sony and Kobo eReaders support the same eBook formats (EPUB and PDF) and books from both stores are Adobe DRM protected, so people sometimes purchase books from one store and read on another eReader. Part 1 explains how to transfer both DRM-free and DRM-protected eBooks to Kobo, so here is how to add books from other stores to Sony eReader. I take Kobo books for example.

**Step1:** Launch Sony Reader software.

**Step2:** Connect your Sony reader to computer with the supplied USB cable.

**Step3:** Click "eBook Store" on the left side of Sony Reader Library, click "Sign In" to fill in your Sony account info. When the message "A Device Has Been Detected" pops, click the "Authorize" button to input your Adobe ID & password. Your Sony eReader will be authorized in seconds.

**Step 4:** [Follow this guide to download Kobo books from Kobo site and open with ADE](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). Then drag and drop the downloaded Kobo books (typically saved under C:\\Users\\**_User ID_**\\Documents\\My Digital Editions for PC or Finder -> Documents -> Digital Editions for Mac) onto the "Library" folder of Reader software.

**Be sure to read the books on ADE first** before you transfer books (especially from 3rd-party stores) to Sony or Kobo. 

#### 2\. Add and read Kindle books on Sony and Kobo eReaders

Many people like to purchase eBooks from Amazon Kindle eBook store due to its more diversified titles at cheaper prices, although Kindle books come in exclusive Kindle formats and are protected with another DRM scheme. To add Kindle books to Kobo or Sony eReaders, we have to first strip Kindle DRM protection from the books, then convert Kindle formats to Kobo and Sony supported EPUB or PDF. 

Download Epubor Kindle DRM Removal tool:

Here is[how to read Kindle books on Kobo Vox](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). The first method is also applicable to E-ink Kobo Touch, Kobo Glo, Kobo Mini, Kobo Aura HD and Sony eReaders.

#### 3\. Add EPUB and PDF books to Kobo Android app and Kobo iPad/iPhone/iTouch app 

![Add books to Kobo iPad/iPhone/Android app - Kobo icon](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kobot_ipad.png)Purchased Kobo books will be synced on Kobo for Android app or Kobo for iOS app automatically. For side loaded books, however, you don't have to transfer them to Kobo for Android/iOS app (I personally don't think them awesome) since there have been many good 3rd-party reader apps on Android and iOS.

These instructions do not work when I tried to use Adobe Digital Editions to put a book purchased from the Sony bookstore on my Kobo Glo. When I did the drag and drop I got a message that said: "No permission to copy the book." Not sure how to get around that.

Hi there, 

 1\. Make sure your Kobo Glo is authorized with your Adobe ID (matches the one connected to your Sony account).  
 Launch ADE, attach your Kobo to PC with the USB cable and tap "Connect" on the Kobo. Your Kobo device will show up on the left-hand side in ADE (library mode). Click the cog icon above to select authorize (or deauthorize) the device.  
 After the Kobo Glo is authorized, drag the Sony books to the left Kobo icon.

 2\. If Step1 does not work, you can try Adobe DRM Removal to decrypt your Sony books. When the books are DRM-free, you can easily add them to your eReader.

Second strategy worked, with DRM removal. Thanks! Unfortunately, that software gave me two free DRM-removals but now I'll have to buy it.

Hi, avidreader

 That's it. Many readers find they have to get their eBooks DRM removed at last.

 Anyway, I am glad that you resolved your problem.

Seriously the Kobo Glo is the biggest piece of crap I have ever had the miserable chance to use. I recommend this pain and suffering on no one. Please get yourself an android tablet with fbreader and forget about Kobo.

Why not just download the Kobo BOOKS to your Kobo Clara HD? If there are two differe Kobo accounts, please download the Kobo books via Kobo for pc/mac, and then run Epubor software to remove the drm and then transfer them to your Kobo Clara HD.
