## [ Facebook Ads Manager](https://apps.apple.com/app/facebook-ads-manager/id964397083)

![Facebook Ads Manager app](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Yx5vNmJ3Tw1nZrP0zQMPmn7Yp2I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/005-use-facebook-more-productively-4111274-96be37f9a98d4a9a90ad4489eb4a8142.jpg)

* Turn ad campaigns on and off.

 What We Don't Like

## [ Facebook Business Suite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.pages.app)

![The Facebook Business Suite displaying a business page](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uVjKp6Lj1hTjYjvw7_kxX5jcxAE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002-use-facebook-more-productively-4111274-738f2f4cd7b74747b6fbe29ba317e446.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Managing multiple pages on your phone is simple.
* Intuitive calendar for scheduling posts.
* Adds a layer of security.
* It's free.

 What We Don't Like

* Buggy reports following updates.
* No "Save as draft" option.
* Learning curve is not user-friendly.
* Promoting posts and managing ads requires a fee.

 Facebook Business Suite replaces[ Facebook Pages Manager](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-pages-manager-1240568) and contains many of the features contained in Creator Studio.

 Rather than switching back and forth between Facebook,[ Facebook Messenger](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-messenger-4103719) , and Instagram, Business Manager checks for all engagement data from one home page that is accessible on both desktop and mobile. Use it to create, schedule, and promote posts, see notifications from Facebook and Instagram accounts, and automate responses to DMs.
