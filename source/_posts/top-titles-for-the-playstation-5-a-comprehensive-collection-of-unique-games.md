## Top Titles for the PlayStation 5: A Comprehensive Collection of Unique Games

Close 

 The PlayStation 5 launched in 2020 with a handful of exclusive titles, and its library of PS5-only games has only grown since then. Here are all of the exclusives – both released and announced – for the PlayStation 5.

Some titles are also available on PC, but this article will count a game as an "exclusive" if it's available on PlayStation 5 but not PS4 or Microsoft or Nintendo consoles.

  
Looking for PSVR 2 games? [Check out our full list here](https://www.lifewire.com/psvr-2-games-list-7509088).

##  Astro's Playroom 

 Exclusive to PS5, this demo controller game comes pre-loaded with the console. This game is a sequel to Astro Bot Rescue Mission. Designed to showcase the new Dual-Sense controller for PS5, you can explore the different haptic sensations as Astro runs, bounces, and even struggles through sand. It's not amazing, but it is a fun 3D way to get used to the new controller's capabilities.

**Release Date**: November 2020

of 28

##  Concord 

 Not much news about this one yet, but it takes place in space. You'll play the role of a "freegunner," and the tone seems a bit light and has some retro-'80s vibes to it.

 Game director Ryan Ellis describes _Concord_ as a "PVP, multiplayer first-person shooter." Presumably, that means that players will face off and compete over resources, loot, and upgrades.

**Release Date**: TBD

03

of 28

##  Dark Life Excalibur 

 This heavily _Dark Souls_\-inspired action-adventure title sets main character Aron off on a quest of vengeance with the legendary sword Excalibur. You'll customize and power up both your character and the mythical blade to take on fearsome enemies and uncover a great mystery.

**Release Date**: TBA

##  Demon's Souls 

 Bluepoint Games remade FromSoftware's PS3 classic for the newer hardware. Along with the stunning visual polish, the title also received new items and mirrored levels to provide more challenge to seasoned players.

**Release Date**: November 2020

of 28

##  Destruction AllStars 

 Racing fans! Tired of the same old racing games? Then be transported into the wild world of racing where, if _Fortnite_, _Twisted Metal_, and _Rocket Leagu_e had a baby together, this is the wide-eyed animated result. It's futuristic vehicular combat at its finest, really, with the always satisfying goal of wrecking as many cars as possible.

**Release Date**: February 2021

06

of 28

##  Fairgames 

 This multiplayer, heist-driven title has you putting together a crew and doing some Robin Hooding to reclaim wealth from those who have too much. This one looks like it'll be a live-service title like _Destiny_, meaning it will receive regular updates and focus on loot and cosmetics.

**Release Date**: TBA

07

of 28

##  Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Intergrade 

_Final Fantasy 7 Remake_ is an enhanced and updated version of the PS4 original. _Intergrade_ has an improved frame rate and other technical bumps. Other additions include a photo mode and a new control scheme. It also has some exclusive DLC starring series favorite Yuffie Kisaragi. If you already bought the PS4 version, you can grab this update for free (although the DLC doesn't come with it).

**Release Date**: June 2021

##  Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth 

 The second part of the _Final Fantasy 7_ remake trilogy is coming exclusively to PlayStation 5, though the first part was also out for PS4\. The continuing adventures of Cloud Strife and his ridiculously oversized sword should adopt some of the gameplay updates we saw in _Intergrade_.

##  Forspoken 

 Originally under development as "Project Athia," _Forspoken_ tells the story of Frey, a modern-day woman who is mysteriously transported to the more fantastical world of Athia. There, she has to use magic and parkour (and sometimes both at the same time) to find her way home and maybe overthrow some tyrants.

**Release Date**: January 2023

of 28

##  Helldivers 2 

 This sequel to the 2015 original changes the perspective from top-down to over-the-shoulder and brings in a huge scoop of _Starship Troopers_ for fun. You'll play as one of the eponymous Helldivers, traveling to distant planets to shoot up alien bugs, ostensibly for freedom and democracy.

**Release Date**: February 2024

##  Horizon: Forbidden West – Burning Shores 

 This DLC for Guerilla Games' _Horizon: Forbidden West_ is a PS5 exclusive, even though the base game is available on both that console and the last-gen PS4\. It takes Aloy to post-apocalyptic Los Angeles to face new threats in the form of rogue, animal-themed robots.

##  The Last of Us: Part 1 

 The PlayStation 5 is the third console to have _The Last of Us_; it debuted on the PS3 in 2013\. However, _The Last of Us: Part 1_ seems to be the definitive version of the title, and it's exclusive to the PS5\. Developer Naughty Dog rebuilt the original from scratch to make full use of the hardware's power and features. This remake has improved combat and exploration along with a speedrunning mode and more accessibility options.

**Release Date**: September 2022

##  Marvel's Spider-Man: Remastered 

 The original version of developer Insomniac's _Marvel's Spider-Man_ launched on PS4, but the PS5 remaster adds enough to the title to merit inclusion. Along with a new face model for Peter Parker, _Remastered_ includes the original game's DLC, DualSense control functionality, and some new costumes.

**Release Date**: November 2023

15

of 28

##  Marvel's Spider-Man 2 

 This follow-up to _Spider-Man_ and _Spider-Man: Miles Morales_ lets you control both Spider-Mans as they take on Kraven the Hunter. The tracker has come to New York in search of some new prey, which includes Lizard and the webslingers.

 Peter wears the famous symbiote suit in this one, at least for a little while, and it seems to be affecting his mood. The gameplay premiere showed off switching between Peter and Miles on a chase through the city.

**Release Date**: October 2023

##  Marvel's Wolverine 

 The same studio making the _Spider-Man_ series is also making a title based around the most popular member of the X-Men.

**Release Date**: TBA

##  Pacific Drive 

 Pacific Drive drops you into the middle of a surreal version of the Pacific Northwest with nothing between you and certain doom but your car. You'll make forays into the woods to collect scrap and supplies to upgrade the vehicle and make your way to the mysterious Pacific Exclusion Zone.

 This one is a bit like _Mad Max_ plus _Annihilation_, which means it sounds super cool and interesting.

**Release Date**: February 2024

##  Phantom Blade Zero 

 This action game takes an approach the developer calls "Kung-fu Punk." It's a mashup of fighting styles, cultural elements, and aesthetics, including some steampunk, samurai characters, and the occult.

**Release Date**: November 2023

**Release Date**: June 2021

##  Silent Hill 2 (Remake) 

 This updated version of the 2001 classic followed James Sunderland, who goes to the resort town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his dead wife. Unfortunately, the town is cursed. It soon turns its malevolent forces against him, creating monsters based on his deepest fears and insecurities.

**Release Date**: TBA

##  Silent Hill: The Short Message 

 Konami surprised "_Silent Hill_" fans by announcing and releasing this entry on the same day. And it's free to download.  

_The Short Message_ is, well, short; it only takes a couple of hours to get through. You play as Anita, a teenager who goes to a derelict apartment complex after receiving mysterious text messages from her late friend. That premise is a little _Silent Hill 2_, but _The Short Message_ distinguishes itself with its tense, combat-free story and cramped environment.

**Release Date**: January 2024

##  Stellar Blade 

 This action-adventure game gives you the small mission of reclaiming Earth from alien invaders after all of humanity leaves the planet. You'll do equal parts fighting and exploring to bring the remnants of the human race together and take back the planet.

**Release Date**: April 2024

##  Sword of the Sea 

 This beautiful-looking game from the creators of _Journey_, _The Pathless_, and _Abzu_ casts you as a lone wanderer in a vast desert. That's all pretty familiar if you've played _Journey_, but the twist here is that you get around by using your sword to surf around on the dunes. It looks like you're on a quest to bring water to restore the area and repopulate it with huge sea creatures.

##  Towers of Aghasba 

 In this game, you'll work to make the distressingly named Withered Lands habitable. Doing so involves building settlements, scrounging for resources, and generally exploring. You'll also meet some of the local creatures, including a huge tortoise and some sky whales (that are also huge).

##  Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection 

_Legacy of Thieves_ contains two full games: _Uncharted 4: A Thief's End_ and _Uncharted: The Lost Legacy_. The former is the final outing of adventurer and treasure hunter Nathan Drake, who destroys every vehicle he enters. _Lost Legacy_ stars two of the series' supporting characters as they search for the Tusk of Ganesh in India.

 These are both remasters of PS4 games, but this collection is exclusive to the PS5.
