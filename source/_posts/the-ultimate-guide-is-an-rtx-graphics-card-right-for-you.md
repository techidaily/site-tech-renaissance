 What We Like

* An interesting concept with lots of possibilities.
* A great tool for settling disputes.

 What We Don't Like

* Turn-based play doesn't match excitement of real air hockey.
* Some of the built-in bets are a bit crude.

_Let’s Puck It!_ puts an interesting spin on an old American pastime by encouraging players to wager bets. You can choose from a list of options like “loser buys dinner,” or you can make up your own stakes. Be careful what you wager because the pace of the puck increases with every volley.
