## Is It Safe to Get Your iPhone 13 Wet or Should You Avoid It?
 The Apple iPhone 13 lineup comes with exciting features such as[cinematic mode](https://www.lifewire.com/the-iphone-13s-cinematic-mode-is-plain-stunning-5201369) and a 120Hz refresh rate. Another primary attribute all iPhone 13 models share is protection against dust, splashing, and immersion in water—within limits.

 That feature means iPhone 13 phones are water-resistant but not waterproof.

## How Waterproof Is the iPhone 13?

 The iPhone 13 isn’t completely waterproof. However, all iPhone 13 models, including the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max, are water resistant with an IP68 rating.

 IP, or ingress protection, ratings fall under the[International Electrotechnical Commission](https://www.iec.ch/ip-ratings) (IEC) 60529 standard, which rates how well devices hold up to dust and moisture.

 IP grades are the industry standard for electronics. You’ll find IP ratings on headphones, smartwatches, and various other personal gadgets.

 IP numbers come in two parts:

* **Dust protection** : The first number measures dust protection on a scale from no protection (zero) to wholly sealed off (six).
* **Moisture resistance:**  The second number goes from no seal (zero) to complete protection against water pressure from multiple angles—and hot water too (nine).

 The IP68 rating on iPhone 13 indicates these phones are well protected against dust and are also water-resistant but not fully waterproof.

 What does that mean in real life? Whether you accidentally drop your phone in a pool or intentionally take your phone with you in water, your iPhone 13 should be okay.

 Apple states all four iPhone 13 models can be submerged and protected in water up to 6 meters deep for up to 30 minutes.

## Is There Any iPhone That Is Waterproof?

 No iPhone is entirely waterproof, but many models after iPhone 7 come with water resistance. Several of the newer iPhone generations share or come close to iPhone 13’s water protection.

 Models with the same IP68 resistance to splashing, dust, and immersion in up to 6 meters of water for a maximum of 30 minutes include:  

* iPhone 15
* iPhone 15 Plus
* iPhone 15 Pro
* iPhone 15 Pro Max
* iPhone 14
* iPhone 14 Plus
* iPhone 14 Pro
* iPhone 14 Pro Max
* iPhone 12
* iPhone 12 mini
* iPhone 12 Pro
* iPhone 12 Pro Max

 If your iPhone is exposed to or dunked in water, Apple recommends drying the device by gently tapping it against your hand with the lightning connector facing downward. You’ll also want to avoid charging or using the Lightning or USB-C port on your iPhone until it’s dry.

 Some iPhones also hold the IP68 rating but can’t be immersed as deeply in water. These models come with IP68 protection in up to 4-meter depths for 30 minutes:  

* iPhone 11 Pro
* iPhone 11 Pro Max

 Other iPhones can withstand only 2-meter depths for 30 minutes maximum. This list includes:

* iPhone 11
* iPhone XS
* iPhone XS Max

 Several older iPhones cut back the water resistance further with an IP67 rating. This rating offers dust protection and tolerance to submersion in 1-meter depths for 30 minutes.  

* iPhone SE (2nd generation)
* iPhone XR
* iPhone X
* iPhone 8
* iPhone 8 Plus
* iPhone 7
* iPhone 7 Plus

 The above iPhones can also withstand everyday spills from beverages such as coffee, tea, and juice. If you need to[clean your phone](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-phone-screen-4688907) , Apple recommends avoiding soaps or detergents.

## Can iPhone 13 Take Pictures Under Water?

 While iPhone 13 models can handle submersion in 6-meter depths for 30 minutes, you’ll probably want to think twice before taking your phone unprotected on your next snorkeling venture.

 Don’t leave anything to chance. Make sure you seal off your iPhone 13 against moisture by investing in a waterproof case.

 You might be OK with a simple plastic case in shallow water. Heavier-duty aluminum cases with a fully waterproof seal or mounting systems and lens attachments could be even better, depending on the type of photos you want to capture.
