##  How to Get the Best Night Mode Shots 

 Your iPhone is pretty good at helping you get the best Night mode shots, but there are a few key things you can do to enhance your chances of getting a great photo. Here are some tips.

* **Hold your iPhone steadily** : It's not always easy to do, especially if you have mobility issues, but try to hold your iPhone as steady as possible when taking the photo. Doing this is necessary during dark scenes as the iPhone needs to keep the shutter open for longer to get the best image.
* **Leave the manual settings alone** : Yes, it's possible to adjust things manually, but you are best leaving your iPhone to do what it believes is best. The automation features are generally the most accurate settings.
* **Use a tripod** : If you can, buy a tripod and use it to take the most stable of photos. If you plan on taking a lot of pictures of the sky at night, this is nearly essential.
* **Don't take photos of anything moving** : Night mode works best with images that aren't mobile. Try to ensure the person or pet you're photographing is still when you hit the button.
