## Why A TV Screen Shows Lines

 If lines appear on your TV, you'll want to inspect the TV itself. You can fix some issues that cause lines to appear, but others may require a professional or a new TV altogether. Some of the most common causes of horizontal lines are:

* LCD screen damage. The LCD provides your TV display with light. If you're handy, you might be able to fix this by doing a little work with the insides of the TV, which you can read about below.
* Loose cables causing a bad connection to the TV. If you've moved your TV around at all, this could be the reason you see lines.
* Other devices you've connected to the TV. They may also be having issues of their own or might not be compatible with your TV. In this case, you'll have to inspect the device instead of the TV.

 All these issues can be fixed, though it ranges in difficulty.

## How Do I Fix Horizontal Lines on My TV?

 Here are some things you can try to fix those lines appearing on your TV, starting with the easiest options to try.

1. Knock or tap on the back of your TV. If the issue is with cable connections, this could solve the problem. It could also indicate a problem with your T-Con board. It won't fix the issue, and the lines may reappear, but it can give some insight into the problem. If it's your T-Con board, you'll want to[have T-Con replaced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aInbxbICue4&ab%5Fchannel=ShopJimmy.com) .
2. Change your TV's settings. This step might work for you if the issue isn't because of damage. First, try switching the TV input from different HDMI ports or AV ports. Doing this can rule out problems with specific inputs.
3. Run a picture test on your TV. It's a built-in feature on newer TV's which allows you to see if the TV display is corrupted. Doing this may look different depending on your TV, but generally, you can go into the settings and find a support option or just a picture test option.
4. Take a look at the LCD screen. If it's damaged, you may want to get the screen repaired or replaced. It may be a less costly option than buying a new TV altogether.

## What Causes a Line on a TV Screen?

 When any part of a TV's display gets damaged, corrupted, or is defective, it can cause lines to appear on the screen. Some TV parts that can cause horizontal lines to appear are the LCD panel, T-Con board, or row drivers.

 Issues with these parts can happen for many reasons, and the way your lines appear can tell you a lot about what's wrong. If the lines are new, one of these parts was likely damaged.

 Connections between TV parts may also get interrupted, causing horizontal lines. Sometimes this may happen on its own, or if the TV was damaged.

 If you're seeing colored horizontal lines, it may be because of the T-Con board. If other parts don't seem to be an issue, this part of the TV could be causing the lines.
