## Top Recommended Samsung Smart TV Applications - Enhance Your Viewing Experience

Hundreds of Samsung apps for Samsung Smart TVs are available, but which are the best must-have apps?

 You get the obvious streaming video apps with Netflix, Vudu, Amazon, and Hulu included on Smart TVs, but there are many other TV apps out there. You might be surprised at what you'll discover among the many apps available. Some apps are quite helpful, such as news, weather, education, and other information, and game apps can be fun.

 Here's a list that will help you decide which ones you want to try.

 What We Like

* Lots of original videos.
* Has an On Demand feature where you can rent or buy movies.

 What We Don't Like

* Interface is a bit sparse.
* Doesn't provide much information on the videos.

 Everybody watches YouTube, but that isn't the only source of free, original, uploaded video content. Vimeo offers thousands of videos from many sources, including aspiring amateur filmmakers. The best way to get started is by checking out Vimeo's staff picks. Categories include music videos, short documentaries, comedy, and more.

You're ready to go once you have the app and media server installed.

 The basic app is free, but you can upgrade to PLEX Premium ($4.99 mo, $39.99 yr, $119.99 lifetime). This lets you watch and record live TV on your computer or in the cloud (antenna and tuner required, as well as the ability to sync your content with compatible mobile devices).
