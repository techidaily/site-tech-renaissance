## How to Watch the 'Superman' Movies in Release Order

 If you have a healthy chunk of time to spare for a movie marathon, you could easily get through the original four_Superman_ movies in a weekend.

 The whole gang is there: ambitious Lois Lane who inexplicably can’t spell, Clark Kent’s gee-whiz disguise marked by oversized glasses and his hair parted on the opposite side, Jimmy Olsen’s trusty camera and enthusiasm, and the no-nonsense_Daily Planet_ editor Perry White.

 Let’s not forget two other important supporting characters from these films: the impressive precision of Superman’s S-shaped forehead curl and his favorite changing vessel: the trusty phone booth.

 The Superman retellings from the 2000s largely phase out the trademarks of the Man of Steel’s 80’s hairdo and his penchant for phone booths, but your favorite characters are still there.

 Ready to compare notes? Here’s the best way to do that on your chosen streaming platform.

 If a movie isn't available on your streaming platform of choice, you can likely buy or rent it from someplace like Amazon, Apple TV, or Google Play.

## How to Watch the 'Superman' Movies By Era

 You could also break up your viewing with a couple of strategic groupings by series.

### The Christopher Reeve Era

 These films feature many fans' favorite Superman, Christopher Reeve, who played both the strong and confident Man of Steel and the bumbling, mild-mannered Clark Kent perfectly.

 While not officially a part of the Christopher Reeve era,_Superman Returns_ includes many elements of that run, including the theme music and Marlon Brando as Jor-El. You also can't ignore Brandon Routh's strong resemblance to Reeve.

| _Superman III_                     | Max                |
| _Superman IV: The Quest for Peace_ | Max                |
| _Superman Returns_                 | Max                |

 If you’re less concerned about chronological order or release order and more interested in comparing similar storylines, here are a few suggested non-linear pairings.

### Compare Origin Stories

 Origin stories are a quintessential part of superhero anything. Watch the original_Superman: The Movie_ and_Man of Steel_ to see where the two meet and diverge. There’s a considerable time gap between the two, 1978 versus 2013, but all things considered, the special effects from 1978 still hold up in their own (often comical) way.

 If you’re interested in seeing more, several platforms offer extended cuts and special editions of both the Christopher Reeve era and DCEU Superman movies. Look for these versions on Amazon Prime, Google Play, Vudu, and YouTube.

### Something Old, Something New, Something Newer

 If you want to experience the Christopher Reeve era but don’t want to watch the whole series, you don’t have to._Superman II_ does a great job of summarizing the first movie in the intro credits and features two formidable enemies: General Zod and Lex Luthor._Superman III_ and_Superman IV_ are not as good, so you can leave it at the second one.

 As for the newer options, you have your pick between a few. You could opt for the stand-alone retelling in the mid-aughts or a_Man of Steel_ /_Batman v. Superman_ /_Justice League_ triple-feature.
