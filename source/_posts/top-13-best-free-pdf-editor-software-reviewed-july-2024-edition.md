## [Best Parent Monitoring App: Qustodio](https://qustodio.sjv.io/c/2104074/1369892/8259)

![Qustodio parental control app](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AGCzP9JeLKYr5zZ9lAc1aqcjM4c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/800x533_games___apps_mobile_en_720-083221de93f04a4fb09501a33c55dc2d.png)

 What We Like

* Available on smartphones, tablets, and PCs.
* Filters web content on all browsers.
* Free trial available.

 What We Don't Like

* The annual fee starts at $54.95 for five devices.
* iOS version can’t limit video game playtime.

 While it requires a bit of an investment, Qustodio is a popular monitoring app for parents, and for good reason. The app is available on iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Kindle and allows parents to receive daily reports on the apps their kids are using and how much time they spend on their devices.

 Parents can set specific screen time windows, outside of which the device becomes unusable, and the advanced web filtering limits the content minors can view while surfing the web, whether they use[Safari](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-safari-4173608) , Firefox, Edge, or another browser. A free account can offer basic protection on one device, but multi-device monitoring requires a membership.

**Price** : Free; Premium plans start at $54.95.

**Download For:**

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/qustodio-parental-control/id990229433)

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qustodio.qustodioapp)

## [Best Content Blocker Service: OpenDNS Family Shield](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/)

![OpenDNS FamilyShield website.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zcu_lkQ2S_9w7HfR2I2FM2eX2IY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/6-best-parental-control-apps-of-2019-06-opendns-ea8f0bcf14e543b7bfbf4dcfe053b867.jpg)

OpenDNS

 What We Like

* Affects every device in the home.
* Completely free.

 What We Don't Like

* Only works with your internet connection, not mobile.
* Setup is fairly complex and can take a while.
* It's a service. Not an app.

 OpenDNS FamilyShield is a free service that prevents everyone who connects to your internet connection from accessing adult or inappropriate content when online.

 What's particularly impressive is how the security settings affect every single device in a household, from personal computers to smartphones and tablets.

**Price** : Free.

 OpenDNS FamilyShield isn't an actual app you download to your iPhone or Android smartphone, but it's a service that can help control what content the mobile devices in your house can access.

## [Best Parental Control Android App: ESET Parental Control](https://parentalcontrol.eset.com/?stscheck=NwAwAGYAMgBhADkANAA3AC0AYwBlAGUAYgAtADQANAA0AGEALQBhAGQANwA3AC0AYQBmADIAMQBhAGEAMwAwAGYAMwA1ADAA)

![ESET Parental Control app on Android.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UwtjSnqBQxaSDMqKaP0jUv9d8VA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/6-best-parental-control-apps-of-2019-05-eset-2f0aa282653c473d8b0949966403624b.jpg)

ESET

 What We Like

* A lot of functionality in the free version.
* Monitors web, app, and other usage.
* 30-day trial of premium features.

 What We Don't Like

* $69.99 annual subscription needed for all features.
* The web filtering is good, but isn’t foolproof.

 While many parental monitoring apps on Android require a premium fee to unlock all of their features, ESET offers a surprising amount for its free version.

 Once parents download and install the app on a tablet or smartphone, they can monitor the websites their children visit, limit what apps they can install from the Google Play Store, set time limits for certain apps, limit how much money they can spend on digital purchases, and view a basic activity report.

 The yearly premium subscription unlocks web filtering, which restricts what kids can see online, and also provides a tracking tool for parents to pinpoint where their children are in the real world—but these are features offered elsewhere for free.

 Parents can also monitor all activity from the ESET website, which is convenient for households with only a few smart devices.

**Price** : Free; Premium version for $69.99 annually.

* Generates activity summaries.

 What We Don't Like

* No social media monitoring.

 It can be difficult for parents to monitor their children’s gaming, but the Microsoft Family Safety app is a free set of tools to monitor and limit what their children do on[Xbox One](https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291) , Windows 11, and Android devices using Microsoft Edge.

 This app includes free web filtering, app blocking, and scheduling for up to six family members. The app’s content filters create a safe environment for children of any age by designating suitable sites that are always allowed and never allowed.

**Price** : Free with in-app purchases available.  

**Download For** :

## [Best Parental Control Service for PlayStation Gamers: Family on PSN](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/network/family/)

![Sony PlayStation 4's Family on PSN settings.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Y3WGDUi6GAXSgq0pQ6jN1aIcq1w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/6-best-parental-control-apps-of-2019-06-ps4-81cdfcc4516841f7b42af493c147ba99.jpg)

Sony

 What We Like

* Filter game and media content, including DVDs.
* Parents can limit how long children play games.

 What We Don't Like

* Fully managed on PS4 and PS5; no smartphone app.
* Confusing for parents who don’t use PlayStation console.

 Sony’s[PlayStation 4](https://www.lifewire.com/ps4-ps4-slim-and-ps4-pro-4154452) doesn’t have a standalone app solution for controlling kids’ screen time like the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, but it does feature some solid settings built into the console that can be accessed in**Settings** \>**Parental Controls/Family Management** \>**Family Management** .

 Once activated, these parental control settings can limit how much time children can spend playing video games each day and between what hours. Parents can also select which age ratings they’ll allow for video games, digital media, and DVD and Blu-ray discs, which can bring peace of mind whenever the kids play alone.

**Price** : Free.
