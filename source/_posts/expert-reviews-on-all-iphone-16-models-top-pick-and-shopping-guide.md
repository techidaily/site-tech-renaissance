Apple's annual rollout of next-gen iPhones has begun. Starting on September 20, customers will be presented with four new options when they walk into an Apple store: the [iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [iPhone 16 Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), and [iPhone 16 Pro Max](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp). That means Apple officially sells nine different iPhone models now -- and that's not counting [certified-refurbished devices](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fiphone%3F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp).

## Should you buy an iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Plus?

**Kerry Wan:** The baseline iPhones have never been the flashiest, but that's a big reason why they tend to last the longest among smartphones and are a popular choice among mainstream consumers. The average iPhone owner holds onto their phone, on average, for 3 to 4 years now. Going into this buying cycle, iPhone 13 users (and those on older models) should prepare for three big changes: switching from a notch to [Dynamic Island](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dynamic-island-on-the-iphone-14-pro-tips-and-tricks/), the physical SIM card slot to [eSIM](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-esim-how-to-transfer-your-phone-number-to-apples-new-iphone/) (if you're in the US), and the [Lightning port to USB-C](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-is-replacing-the-iphones-lightning-port-with-usb-c-what-buyers-need-to-know/). For most people, these three shifts should bring added functionality, convenience, and interoperability.

**Also: [Should you upgrade to iPhone 16? Here are ZDNET editors' top reasons for and against](https://www.zdnet.com/article/should-you-upgrade-to-iphone-16-here-are-zdnet-editors-top-reasons-for-and-against/)**

If you're currently using an iPhone 14 or iPhone 15, there are three reasons to consider upgrading: the dedicated Action button for mapping unique functions (e.g., screenshotting, Siri shortcuts, switching Focus modes, etc.), the new touch-capacitive [Camera Control](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/) for a more DSLR-like capturing experience, and [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ai-features-iphone-users-can-expect-first-on-ios-18-and-whats-coming-later/). Due to hardware requirements -- which include the amount of RAM and the processing power -- any standard iPhone model before the 16 won't be able to run Apple's current (and future) artificial intelligence tools, including the [improved Siri](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-will-improve-siri-in-2024-but-dont-expect-most-updates-until-2025/), notification summaries, audio transcriptions, photo-editing features, and more.

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

Fortunately, most Apple Intelligence features [won't be readily available](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-you-shouldnt-buy-the-iphone-16-for-apple-intelligence/) when the iPhone 16 launches, so if accessing the latest AI tools compels you to consider upgrading, I'd think twice about what you're getting today and what's been [promised for later](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-reportedly-delays-the-first-apple-intelligence-features-until-october/). My advice is that unless your carrier offers a generous trade-in deal for your iPhone 14 or 15, you should wait a few more months and see how Apple progresses with its AI developments and if there are any features you would use on a regular basis.

**Also: [I demoed Apple's standard iPhone 16 and didn't envy the Pro models at all](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-demoed-apples-standard-iphone-16-and-didnt-envy-the-pro-models-at-all/)** 

The new colors -- five bold and striking finishes -- are some of the best I've seen Apple offer in years. There's more personality to them than the cast of _[Inside Out 2](https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/159047/564546/9358?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fmovies%2Finside-out-2%2F6MeZYf9JkFii&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp)_. Based on estimated delivery dates, the Ultramarine and Teal appear to be favorites, so I'd consider your color preference(s) if you're looking to get the iPhone 16 shipped as soon as possible. It also helps to check the delivery dates based on storage tiers. Base configurations tend to be the most popular, so if you can justify a 256GB or 512GB model, the upcharge may be worth the money (and faster delivery time).

Lastly, if you value one-handed usability and comfort, go with the [smaller iPhone 16](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp). If you value longer battery life and a more immersive viewing experience and are willing to pay $100 more for those benefits, go with the [iPhone 16 Plus](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp). Everything else about the two models, from the camera systems to the processors to the charging speeds, are identical.

## Who should buy the iPhone 16 Pro series?

**Jason Hiner:** I've used the "Pro" iPhone models since they were first introduced with the iPhone 11 Pro, and I've used the bigger "phablet" versions of the iPhone since they first arrived with the iPhone 6 Plus. This year, I've got some specific advice if you're looking to buy the iPhone 16 Pro or the iPhone 16 Pro Max. 

If you're coming from an iPhone 13 Pro or Pro Max (or earlier) and your device is struggling with battery life issues or is simply wearing out, then this is a no-brainer upgrade -- and there are some [good deals](https://www.zdnet.com/article/preorder-the-iphone-16-now-and-even-get-one-for-free-heres-how/) out there if you get your phone through your wireless carrier. But definitely get the 16 this year, and don't settle for the 15 -- even if the latter is on sale -- because that will better future-proof you to take advantage of new AI features in the years ahead.

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

If you're coming from an iPhone 14 Pro or Pro Max or an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max and your phone is working perfectly well, then I'd say you should hold off and see what's new in 2025 and 2026\. This year's model is similar enough to the last two, so unless you're putting a magnifying glass on the smallest changes, you won't miss out on much. The one exception is if you're on one of the iPhone 14 Pro models and you want to take advantage of Apple Intelligence -- which will arrive later this fall in iOS 18.1\. For that, an upgrade to one of the iPhone 16 Pro models will get the power you need to handle the latest AI features for the next few years.

The other big exception is if you take a ton of photos or videos with your iPhone and truly love mobile photography and video. In that case, the iPhone 16 Pro's signature feature -- the new [Camera Control](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/) \-- could make you the ideal candidate for an upgrade because it's such a game-changer. 

**Also: [Apple just gave me a compelling reason to buy the smaller iPhone 16 Pro over the Max this year](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-just-gave-me-a-compelling-reason-to-buy-the-smaller-iphone-16-pro-over-the-max-this-year/)**

If this is you and you're upgrading from the 14 or 15 to the iPhone 16 Pro or Pro Max, then you should consider joining [Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program](https://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program#link={) or one of the similar programs from carriers like [AT&T](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://www.att.com/buy/phones/browse/apple/) and [Verizon](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-9041660-15905462-1726258549000?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp). These programs let you upgrade yearly and simply pay as though you're leasing the iPhone. That way, you'll be guaranteed to have the latest camera tech and be able to run the latest AI features, and you'll save money in the long run compared to upgrading every year or two.

## Bottom line

That's to say, the [iPhone 16 series](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) brings meaningful upgrades to its design and hardware, so much so that even iPhone 14 and 15 users have reasons to consider upgrading in 2024\. With the backing of [iOS 18](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-is-officially-available-for-iphone-heres-how-to-download-it-and-which-models-support-it/), arguably the most significant iPhone software version in recent years, you're looking at handsets that are more versatile, customizable, and built more for the times than ever before.
