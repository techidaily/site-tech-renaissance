 We've[reviewed the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 240mm](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/arctic-liquid-freezer-ii-240) previously and remarked on how strong the cooling performance was and how quiet the cooler behaved during operation. Our only concern was with how the AIO cooler controls its fan and pump speeds through the same header connection. We awarded this cooler 4 out of 5 stars after it sailed through our benchmarking tests.

 The 240mm Arctic Liquid Freezer II is a neat and tidy solution for your CPU cooling and PC builds, with minimal cables cluttering your case innards as the Arctic Freezer routs the PWM fan cables through the material sleeve of the cooling tubes for a clean look leaving only a short cable run from the pump to the motherboard header. This SKU of the Arctic Liquid Freezer II doesn't have any RGB on the fans, so is perfect for those who don't want the light show but do want a functional cooler.
