 Didn't choose a unique administrator name when you set up your computer, but now you want to add a personal touch? Windows makes it easy to change the administrator name. Here are four quick ways to change the administrator name on Windows 11.

##  1\. Change the Administrator Name Using the Settings App

 If you're signed in with a [Microsoft account](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-sim-unlock-vivo-y17s-phones-without-code-2-ways-to-remove-android-sim-lock-by-drfone-android/) instead of a local account, you can change your name using the link in the Accounts window of the Settings app. To do that, press Windows+i to [open the Settings app](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-5-easy-ways-to-multiply-your-youtube-follower-base/). Then, go to Accounts > Your info > Accounts.

 That's it! The administrator name of your computer is now changed.

##  2\. Change the Administrator Name Using the Control Panel

 The Settings app method only works if you're logged in with a Microsoft account. If you're using a [local account](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/protect-your-system-with-these-15-free-instant-boot-antivirus-tools/), you must change the admin account name using a different method.

 To do this using the [Control Panel](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-facetime-call-recording-securing-your-conversations/), open the Start menu and type "Control Panel" in the search field and press Enter. Change the "View by" to "Category" and navigate to User Accounts > User Accounts > Change your account name.

 Type the new name in the "New account name" field and click "Change Name".

 You'll see the new name appear on the welcome screen and the Start menu.

##  3\. Change the Administrator Name Using the Netplwiz Command

 Netplwiz is a Windows command you can use to manage user accounts on your PC. It allows you to add, remove, or modify your user account. You can also use the netplwiz command to change the administrator name, as follows.

 Then, you'll have to sign out and sign back in for the changes to take effect.

##  4\. Change the Administrator Name Using Command Prompt

 If you are more comfortable using Command Prompt, you can use the wmic command to change the administrator name in Windows 11.

 To begin, [launch Command Prompt with elevated permissions](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-screen-mirroring-xiaomi-14-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-android/). The quickest way to open the Command Prompt as an administrator is to search for it in the Start menu and select the "Run as administrator" option.
