 The Settings app method only works if you're logged in with a Microsoft account. If you're using a [local account](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/protect-your-system-with-these-15-free-instant-boot-antivirus-tools/), you must change the admin account name using a different method.

 To do this using the [Control Panel](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-facetime-call-recording-securing-your-conversations/), open the Start menu and type "Control Panel" in the search field and press Enter. Change the "View by" to "Category" and navigate to User Accounts > User Accounts > Change your account name.

![Change my account name option in the Control Panel](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/change-my-account-name.jpg)
