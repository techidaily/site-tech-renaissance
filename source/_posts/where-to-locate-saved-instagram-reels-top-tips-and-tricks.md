## How to Stop Unwanted Political Text Messages on an iPhone

 Once political groups or campaigns have your phone number, it's very hard to[stop unwanted political text messages](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stop-political-texts-4691829) . That's because organizations share supporters' numbers with each other (or even sell them). The best you can do is to opt out of these texts when you get them to take you off of a group or campaign list. However, this option won't stop others who have your number.

 Most of these texts tell you at the end of the message how to stop receiving them. The most common responses to stop unwanted political texts are**Stop** ,**Opt-Out** ,**Unsubscribe** ,**Cancel** , or**Quit** .

 Reply to the message with the suggested option—if there isn't one, Stop is the best thing to try—and you should be unsubscribed.

## How to Stop Unwanted Text Messages on iPhone By Filtering Unknown Senders

 For various reasons, you may not want to delete every text from an unknown number or person. For instance, you can miss order and appointment confirmation texts if you do. In that case, your iPhone can automatically file texts from unknown senders into a separate folder so you can review them when you have time without them cluttering up your main inbox.

 Here's what to do:

1. Tap**Settings** .
2. Tap**Messages** .
3. Move the**Filter Unknown Senders** slider to on/green.  
![The Settings app, Messages heading, and "Filter Unknown Senders" option on an iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lCnQVucvmXcKMmnaksO8lqPmQJE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Filter-Unknown-Texts-ab03750ad3b2433fa5837828629871fc.jpg)
4. To see your filtered text messages, tap the arrow in the top left-corner until you get to the main Messages screen.
5. Tap**Unknown Senders** to view all texts from numbers not in your contacts.

## How to Stop Unwanted Group Texts on an iPhone

 If you're in a[group text](https://www.lifewire.com/text-multiple-people-using-iphone-2000555) that's just too chatty, you can silence notifications of messages or leave the group entirely by following these steps

1. In the group text, tap the name of the group text or the icons of the people in it at the top of the screen.
2. To stay in the group text without receiving notifications when new messages come in, move the**Hide Alerts** slider to on/green.
3. To completely leave the group text, there are two paths.  
 If there is a mix of iPhones and Android phones in that chat (you'll know because the message bubbles will be green), tap**Delete and Block this Conversation,** and then tap the confirmation pop-up.  
 If everyone has an iPhone (blue message bubbles) and the chat has more than three other people in it, tap**Leave This Conversation** and then tap the confirmation pop-up.

 Change your mind and want to rejoin the group text? You can ask one of the other people in the chat to add you back. Or, if the thread has both iPhone and Android users and it's been less than 30 days since you left, tap the arrow in the top left until you get to the main Messages screen >**Recently Deleted** \> tap the thread >**Recover** .

## Block Texts With the Do Not Call Registry

 Another place to stop annoying communications to your phone is the National Do Not Call Registry. This government program attempts to enforce your preference to not get unwanted calls from marketers and other potential annoyances in the United States.

 It doesn't block calls, and it only works for businesses that follow the law—also, the registry is technically for phone calls, not texts—but it's free, quick, easy, and could help reduce unwanted texts.

[Enroll your phone number with the Do Not Call registry](https://www.donotcall.gov/)
