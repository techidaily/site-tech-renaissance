[What is the work around for Kindle's latest updated version](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/26/2023 10:25:45 AM 

Amazon requires latest updated version 1.39.2.65383 to be able to download Kindle books to my PC. Epubar gives an error and has prompt to auto-downgrade to version 1.32 because of their inability to crack the code in later versions. I tried this and this work around does not work as Kindle will no longer allow downloads of books in the 1.32 version and requires the update to the 1.39.2.65383 version to be able to do this. As such, what fix/ work around do you have to remedy this issue? 

[Parallel Process](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/18/2016 11:56:45 AM 

I think it is good if epubor can do parallel processing.   
 I think current processor are fast enough to parallel process. 

 and sometimes it take very long time to process a book.   
 better to skip it and give a log which we can review later

[Requiring Kindle update](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 2/7/2023 3:40:35 AM 

As of today (Feb 6, 2023), I have one new book (Magic Tides by Ilona Andrews) that gives me this message: Your Kindle app requires an update to view this content. Click here \[link\] to download and install the free updates (supported OS: Windows 10, Windows 8).

 I obviously don't want to do that. Any work arounds?

I have a successful conversion of this attached file from Amazon Kindle, and Epubor reports DRM remove succeeded, and convert to epub succeeded.

[Cannot export google books to ADE](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 11/15/2022 9:10:54 AM 

I've been using epubor for a while and I have exported around 50 ebooks from google play store to ADE and then successfully removed the DRM using epubor.

 Now, out of the blue, when I try to open an ascm file, ADE gives me the following error: 

 E\_ADEPT\_NO\_FULFILLMENT\_RESULT

 Google support and Adobe support have been unable to resolve the issue. Unless I fix this, I can no longer use epubor to remove DRM from google ebooks which I own.

 Has anyone seen this problem and does anybody have a solution?

[Epubor ultimate for Mac crashes a few seconds after opening](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 5/6/2023 8:57:25 AM 

I’ve been a user of Epubor since 2021\. It has worked fine until recently. It crashes right after opening. I deleted the app, downloaded the newest version, and it still crashes. I can give you the cars report if needed. Thanks!  

[Regarding Output Title](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 10/14/2022 6:25:47 AM 

Hi,  
 After the conversion is complete, only the name of the book is given. How can I change it so that the name of the book is followed by the name of the author? I am using the ultimate version. thank you.

[Genuineness of license keys for Epubor Ultimate: Giveaway??](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 1/28/2023 2:39:56 PM 

Can I ask if these serial numbers for Epubor Ultimate are legal? I found them on a site that called them as "giveaway versions", but the site looks a bit shady. So is this giveaway real or just a scam that they used a keygen? I better ask because I haven't found this giveaway anywhere else.  

[New test user just downloaded ... was running trial product](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/22/2022 11:37:12 AM 

I ran into a locked up screen situation on your app and had to stop it. I'm on a Mac mini. Now I cannot get back in without a registration code.

 I'd like to know this works before paying $29.99 or whatever it is.

 Also, I reverted back to Kindle 1.31 from 1.35 using your utility but at some point, maybe after reregistering, it became 1.33\. What gives? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

[KFX to ...](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 8/12/2023 3:49:29 AM 

I tried to convert a KFX file to pdf and was somewhat successful with the trial version and reverting PC Kindle to an old version. That being said the 'sample' text that I was given looked like garbage. Just a very basic sample of 20% of the text that was converted, which is fine as a sample, but I don't want to invest in the full version if what is going to be given to me looks so bad. Does the full converted file retain any of the books formatting or cover photos, etc.? Or will it just be a basic text conversion that looks like it was written in note pad?

[Removing DRM from Nook Color](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 9/10/2022 2:55:20 AM 

I've tested your product; some B&N books are 'cleansed' while others are not. A note in your app suggest I give you my account and access to B&N and you will be able to get the necessary 'keys' for those books.  
 Even if I could remember my account name and password it would do you no good. In 2015 B&N shutdown their server. Actually, no they did not. In 2020 I tried to use my Nook Color to create an Excel book. The office tools were unavailable. To their astonishment, they were surprised I was accessing their server since 2015\. Not so starting in 2020.  
 What I have on my computer is all the books I purchased and 'downloaded' to Nook for PC. It is from my PC that I am converting these ePUB files.. some of them.  
 Is there any solution to stripping B&N's DRM from the remaining books?  
 I will pay you for my licensing of your product after I close this message.
