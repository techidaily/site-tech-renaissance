## IPhone 15 Pro Max One Cent Offer on Amazon? Here's What You Need to Know  Exclusive Insight

The "[free phone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-good-is-that-smartphone-deal-use-this-free-spreadsheet-to-do-the-math/)" deal is nothing new, and if you've clicked into this article with a bit of skepticism, that's normal. Such offers are almost always too good to be true, whether promoted by AT&T, T-Mobile, or Best Buy. For the right customer, however, they're the perfect opportunity to own a new phone for less than retail.

The latest variation of the "free phone" comes via Boost Mobile, which is selling [the iPhone 15](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPhone-Pro-Max-trade%2Fdp%2FB0CHBQTL9Z%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C8cc0bddd-9365-4827-831f-158793586a6f%7Cdtp&dtb=1), including the Pro Max, for one cent. What's the deal with this deal? Let me break down the fine print for you.

[iPhone 15 for one cent (save $1,099) View now at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPhone-Pro-Max-trade%2Fdp%2FB0CHBQTL9Z%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C8cc0bddd-9365-4827-831f-158793586a6f%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

Buying one of the [best iPhones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/) on the market for almost no money is a no-brainer for anyone, but digging into the offer details shows that you must meet three other qualifications to reap the benefits:

* You must enroll in a 36-month installment plan under Boost Mobile.
* A Boost Infinite wireless plan is required and starts at $65 per month.
* The iPhone will be locked to the Boost Mobile network and will be unusable by other carriers.

Basically, the one-cent iPhone is Boost Mobile's way of reeling you into a three-year agreement. The wireless plan that you have to sign up for is how the carrier makes its money back.

If you ever opt out of the contract, you'll have to pay off the rest of the iPhone. Conversely, once you get through the three-year term, you can always resell the iPhone and get some money back.

These qualifications shouldn't surprise you, especially if you've purchased a phone from a carrier before. In fact, if you're already under a monthly data plan that costs roughly the same (if not more), your existing handset has been paid off, and you're ready to try a new (and possibly better) mobile service, this deal is not as bad as it seems. Best of all, you don't have to trade in any qualifying devices.

Before you [take the offer,](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPhone-Pro-Max-trade%2Fdp%2FB0CHBQTL9Z%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C8cc0bddd-9365-4827-831f-158793586a6f%7Cdtp&dtb=1) here are the [key differences](https://www.zdnet.com/article/which-iphone-15-model-should-you-buy-comparing-regular-plus-pro-and-pro-max/) between every iPhone 15 model to help you decide which is best for you:

* iPhone 15: Most standard iPhone 15 experience, with a 6.1-inch display and a slew of pastel colorways
* iPhone 15 Plus: Best battery life iPhone with a big 6.7-inch screen, but has a 60Hz refresh rate panel
* iPhone 15 Pro: Similar feature set as the Pro Max but with a smaller form factor and shorter zoom capabilities
* iPhone 15 Pro Max: Best camera experience thanks to 5x optical zoom and a large AMOLED screen at 120Hz
