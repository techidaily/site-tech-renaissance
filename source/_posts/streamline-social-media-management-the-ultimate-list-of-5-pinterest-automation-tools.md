Close 

 Whether you run a popular food blog, or if you handle the social media posts for the company you work for,[ Pinterest](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-pinterest-3486578) is one social network that can make a big difference in your traffic, sales, opt-ins, and more. 

 Pinterest itself doesn't allow you to schedule pins (Pinterest posts) to be posted at a particular time, but there are many[ third-party tools](https://www.lifewire.com/social-media-apps-for-managing-everything-3486302) that do allow you to schedule pins. A Pinterest scheduler can help you ensure that your pins are being seen by your target audience regularly, and at the right times.

 Here are five great tools to use for scheduling Pinterest posts.

 None of the following tools are free to use indefinitely. If you want to schedule your Pinterest pins past the free trial period, you'll have to pay for one of the following premium social media management tools.
