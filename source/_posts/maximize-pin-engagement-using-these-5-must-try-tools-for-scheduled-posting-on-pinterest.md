## Maximize Pin Engagement Using These 5 Must-Try Tools for Scheduled Posting on Pinterest

Close 

 Whether you run a popular food blog, or if you handle the social media posts for the company you work for,[ Pinterest](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-pinterest-3486578) is one social network that can make a big difference in your traffic, sales, opt-ins, and more. 

 Pinterest itself doesn't allow you to schedule pins (Pinterest posts) to be posted at a particular time, but there are many[ third-party tools](https://www.lifewire.com/social-media-apps-for-managing-everything-3486302) that do allow you to schedule pins. A Pinterest scheduler can help you ensure that your pins are being seen by your target audience regularly, and at the right times.

 Here are five great tools to use for scheduling Pinterest posts.

 None of the following tools are free to use indefinitely. If you want to schedule your Pinterest pins past the free trial period, you'll have to pay for one of the following premium social media management tools.

 Viralwoot is another scheduling tool worth considering for both Pinterest and Instagram. Its interface is clean and clutter-free which might make it a better alternative for people wanting to do without the extra functionality of more advanced tools.

 You can create and schedule pins in bulk from the web, the Viralwoot browser extension, and the Viralwoot mobile app. You can also schedule saves (re-pins) from other Pinterest users, which is a great way to engage with the Pinterest community. And if you have images from other popular apps like Instagram or X, Viralwoot lets you upload directly from 21 integrated apps to help take the headache out of cross-posting.

 What We Like

* Clean, uncluttered interface.
* Can handle bulk pin creation and scheduling.
* Includes browser extension and mobile app.

 What We Don't Like

* Not intuitive.
* Unreliable customer service.
