## Discovering Mobile Tracking Techniques on iOS Devices - Find Out Whereabouts
### What to Know

* The easiest way to track someone with the iPhone is to use the Find My app that's pre-installed on most recent iPhones.
* To find and be found using the Find My, you'll need to enable**Share My Location** with your friends.
* Once enabled, you can track your friends and family (who consent) on a map, and they can track you.

 The article provides instructions for how to see someone on your iPhone after you've gained their permission so that you can keep track of someone or know when you and your friends are nearby the same locations.

## How Can I Check Someone's Location on iPhone?

 The easiest way to check someone's location on iPhone is to use the Find My app. However, in order to use this app, you first need to enable Start Sharing Location, and your friends need to consent to be found using the app. Here's how to go about doing so.

 While there are some third-party apps to track people's location without their knowledge,**Lifewire does not recommend using them** , even for family members and children. If you plan to track someone's location, they should know that you plan to, and if they are adults, you should have their permission to before you begin tracking them.

1. Open Find My on your iPhone and tap the**People** tab.
2. If you've never used Find My for people before, you'll be prompted to**Start Sharing Location** . Tap that option.
3. Select someone from your contact list to share your location with and then tap**Send** .

4. Once the invitation has been sent, then you can tap that person's name to see details about them. If you're not already following them scroll down and tap**Ask to Follow Location** . An invitation will be sent, and once the contact accepts it, you will be able to see their location (as long as they have locations turned on).

## How Can You See Someone's Location in the Find My App?

 Once you've got Find My for people set up on your iPhone, it's easy to see someone's location. Just open the**Find My** app, go to the**People** tab, and tap the name of the person you want to see. If that person has location services turned on, their location should show on a map, and from there, you can tap**Directions** to get directions to their exact location.

 You can also tap**Notifications** to set up a notification for the next time that person**Arrives** ,**Leaves** , or**Is Not At** a specific location (this is sometimes referred to as a geofence). You can set the frequency of those notifications, too.

 FAQ

* How do I see my location history on an iPhone?  
 To find your location history, on an iPhone, open **Settings** and tap**Privacy** \> **Location Services** \> **System Services** . Scroll down and tap**Significant Locations** , then view your location history.
* Why can't I see my friend's location on an iPhone?  
 There are several reasons why you may not be able to view a friend's location. First, if that friend hasn't agreed to share their location with you, you won't be able to see their location via Find My iPhone. If they are sharing their location with you, it's possible their phone is turned off, isn't connected to cellular or Wi-Fi, or their device has the wrong date. The friend may be in a location without service. They also may have enabled**Hide My Location** in Find My iPhone. There may be a problem with your phone, as well. Check your GPS, and try exiting out of the Find My app, then launching it again.
