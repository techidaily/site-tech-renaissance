##  How to Get Started in ‘Pokémon Go’ 

 Due to its more social nature and augmented-reality mechanics,_Pokémon Go_ requires a bit more initial setup than simply installing it to your smartphone.  

1. Open the_Pokémon Go_ app and respond to any pop-ups that appear for things like notifications (not necessary), location sharing (necessary for gameplay), etc.
2. When prompted, enter your date of birth and tap**Submit** . Select**New Player** if this is your first time playing or**Returning Player** if you’ve previously played the game.

3. Choose a method of logging in: Facebook, Google, or Pokémon Trainer Club. If you’re using an iPhone, you can also choose to sign in with Apple or Niantic Kids.

4. Follow the prompts to either log in with your chosen method or set up a new account.
5. Once you’re signed in and the app has the necessary permissions, choose your in-game character’s look from available presets. You can change this later if you want.

6. After Professor Willow’s introduction, you’ll need to accept Niantic’s privacy policy (tap**OK** ) and the terms of service (tap**Accept** ).
7. On the next screen, tap**Continue** to start playing or select**Have a referral code?** to enter a friend’s referral code.

 The Android and iOS setup experiences are slightly different. Some options and pop-ups may appear in a different order, while some may not appear at all depending on the platform.

##  How to Select a Starter in ‘Pokémon Go’ 

 With setup and sign in complete, Professor Willow will give you a brief walkthrough of the basics.  

1. Tap one of the three[ starter Pokémon](https://www.lifewire.com/ten-simple-tips-to-get-started-in-pokemon-4097202) near your on-screen character to choose them and switch to the capture screen.
2. Tap and hold a finger on the Poké Ball at the bottom of the screen to grab it, and then swipe your finger and let go to throw it at your target.
3. If your first throw misses, repeat the process while varying your timing and swipe speed until you succeed.  
![The process of selecting your starter in PokÃ©mon Go](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ElXuptnKfYHh0BdeHtptHZQOj60=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Catching-Starter-69fd669ebf114215aa21cec948a695e1.jpg)
4. Once you catch a Pokémon, you'll see a start screen for its health, weight, type, available moves (for use in raids or at gyms), and more info.

5. Tap the**check** icon at the bottom of the screen to continue.
6. A pop-up will appear, asking you to choose a nickname for your character. Tap**Nickname** in the text window and type in the name you want to use (this might take a few attempts if the name you want is already taken). Tap**Yes** to submit your nickname.
7. When prompted, choose whether or not to allow[ Adventure Sync](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-pokemon-go-adventure-sync-4689082) (let the app monitor your movement, gather items, count distance, etc while closed).  
![captured pokemon stats screen, nickname entry, and Adventure Sync pop-up](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rJ2Nt54yfWWI3eYYg4akTk3r_3o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Starting-Pokemon-Go-72f7c6199a7445c394624fdbd701782a.jpg)
8. _Pokémon Go_ may also ask to access your fitness data. If the pop-up appears, tap**Allow** to give it access or**Don’t Allow** to block it. You can play the game even if you don't share this data.

9. If you choose to allow access, tap the toggle next to each option to add one or more specific forms of tracking. You can also tap**Turn On All** to allow all of them.  
![Motion & Fitness activity access, permissions, and Time to Walk! screen in PokÃ©mon Go](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/EZt9GWVwC_iYcZyZy0QuJsMiirY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Pokemon-Go-Health-sharing-0e7849d1513342b8aacaa45266d883ea.jpg)

_Pokémon Go_ requires that players move around the real world to travel to different locations in-game. Always be mindful of your surroundings and do not trespass onto private property—no pokémon is worth risking your personal safety.

##  How to Catch Pokémon in ‘Pokémon Go’ 

 Now that you have your “starter” Pokémon, you’re free to start adding more creatures to your collection.  

1. Pokémon will appear on the map when you get close enough. Tap a Pokémon to change to the capture screen, and then tap, drag, and release the Poké Ball to try and catch it.
2. You’ll see the Pokémon’s name and Combat Power points in a bubble just above its head. If this is your first time seeing a specific Pokémon, its Combat Power will show as "???."  
 In basic terms, Combat Power determines the Pokémon’s overall power in a fight (how much damage it can do to opposing Pokémon when attacking).
3. Time your throws with the shrinking ring that appears around the Pokémon for[ experience bonuses](https://www.lifewire.com/gain-xp-and-level-up-fast-in-pokemon-go-5074937) (the smaller the ring when the ball connects, the better the bonus).  
![A wild PokÃ©mon on the PokÃ©mon Go map, along with its CP rating and the capture circle](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QtQZMrXT463rfEvv1iBAE5EY3Js=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Capturing-Pokemon-19fbf967a7844cd591caacd473139343.jpg)
4. The color of the ring that moves around the Pokémon may give you a vague idea of how likely it is to break out of the ball when you try to catch it. Green is fairly easy to catch, orange can be a bit wily, and red might require several attempts or a stronger Poké Ball.
5. While on the capture screen, tap the**Poké Balls** icon in the bottom-right corner to change ball types (if you have any others).
6. Tap the**Berries** icon in the bottom-left corner to choose a berry to throw to the Pokémon. Feeding them berries can make them less feisty and easier to catch.  
![A capture ring, the PokÃ© Ball menu, and berries in PokÃ©mon Go](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GP4GSNB19JHUWAo5xxp6h38R-aU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Poke-Balls-and-Berries-ae00e33431b04ccab0488dc77681821d.jpg)
7. It’s also possible to curve the Poké Ball when you throw it by quickly moving your finger in a circular motion before your toss (sparkles around the ball means it’s working).  
 Landing a curve ball increases your chances of catching the Pokémon.
8. Some Pokémon will move around or perform various animations that might throw off your aim or make them temporarily immune to capture. Wait for them to stand still before you move to catch them.
9. It can be worth the effort to catch Pokémon you’ve already caught before. Two of the same Pokémon will often have different stats, while you can trade in your duplicates for candy (more on that below).

 Not all of_Pokémon Go_ 's features are available from the beginning. Capturing Pokémon, performing actions, and completing tasks will cause you to level up, which unlocks more features and options.

##  How to Use the Map in ‘Pokémon Go’ 

 When you’re not catching Pokémon, you'll spend most of your time in_Pokémon Go_ on the main map screen. This area shows an unmarked map of your local area; to reach a given spot, you have to physically move there.  

1. Floating circles with blue cubes in the center represent PokéStops, which often mark real-world locations of interest. When you’re close enough, the icon will change to a floating blue target.  
 Tap the icon to select the PokéStop, and then swipe the circular photo in the center of the screen to spin it and collect some items.
2. Blue, grey, red, or yellow platforms of concentric circles (often when Pokémon appear above them) are gyms. Larger tower-like gym icons denote an EX Raid Gym. These were previously locations for special, invite-only raid battles.  
 The developer removed EX raids in 2020, and they haven't returned.  
![PokÃ©mon Go's map screen, showing PokÃÂ©Stops and Gyms, Gym screen, PokÃÂ©Stop screen](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UFBcNQDb7QyBMdPK9v7P6yyD9U4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Map-Screen-2d69159bba3c49df8545d7d61c42b29d.jpg)
3. Gyms with an egg or orange, angry Pokémon face icon, and timer overhead indicate a raid battle is taking place. The timer denotes how much time is left before the raid boss appears (egg) or how long you have to defeat the raid boss Pokémon before it leaves (angry face).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. In most cases, you need to get within range of the gym’s real-world location to participate in a raid. However, if you’ve purchased a Remote Raid Pass you can use it to participate without having to be physically present.  
 You can only have three Remote Raid Passes in your inventory at once.
5. Tap the**Weather** icon in the top-right corner to check current conditions and see which Pokémon types may appear more often (and with better stats).
6. Tap the**Adventure Incense** icon in the top right to use your daily incense. Adventure Incense can make wild Pokémon appear around your character for 15 minutes of real time.  
![The map screen, weather report, and daily Adventure Incense option in PokÃ©mon Go](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GHZ0t00HJU2FMtQ3m-47AbXbaTA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Map-screen-weather-report-daily-incense-b462e34ee2dc4d209bda01407a7c1fde.jpg)
7. Tap the**Compass** icon in the top-right corner to lock the camera to the direction your character is facing.
8. Tap your**Character** icon in the bottom left to view your character details, including appearance, walking distance, number of Pokémon caught so far, and more.
9. Tap the**Binoculars** icon in the bottom-right corner to view current tasks. Tap on the different tabs (**Events** ,**Today** ,**Special** ) to view them.  
 When you complete a task, tap**Claim Reward** to get the prize for finishing it.  
 The binoculars may also appear as a character icon if Professor Willow, your team leader, or another character has a task for you,

10. Select the bar full of Pokémon icons in the bottom right to see what kinds of Pokémon are near your location. The photo next to their silhouette marks the PokéStop they’re close to. Travel to that PokéStop to find them.
11. You can also tap the**Raid** tab to see what raids are happening nearby.
12. Tap the Pokémon or raid you want to locate, and the map will zoom in on the location temporarily to give you an idea of what direction to go in.
13. The**Route** tab lets you follow an approved route or submit your own. Routes act as preset paths you can follow to sometimes find additional Pokémon, earn rewards, and more.

 You’ll regularly earn all sorts of items (poké balls, berries, potions, stardust, etc) from PokéStops, Gyms, and catching pokémon.

##  How to Take Over Gyms in ‘Pokémon Go’ 

 After you reach level five and visit a gym, you’ll need to join a team: Instinct (yellow), Mystic (blue), or Valor (red). Teams don't have any mechanical differences; however, they regularly battle with each other over gym control.  

1. If your team has control of a gym, you can place Pokémon there to help defend it from rival teams (visit the gym and tap**Assign Pokémon** ). However, you can only place your Pokémon at a gym with an empty spot for it.
2. Defending Pokémon will start to lose motivation as time passes or they’re defeated by rival trainers. They'll leave the gym when their motivation reaches zero.
3. Increase a Pokémon’s motivation by visiting the gym and feeding them berries.
4. Your defending Pokémon will earn PokéCoins over time. They'll bring the coins to you when they return from the gym.
5. If your team doesn’t control a gym, you can battle the defending Pokémon to force them out (by reducing motivation to zero).
6. To battle against Pokémon defending a gym, get close to the gym’s location and select it, and then tap the**Battle** icon.
7. Defending Pokémon will appear at the top of the screen along with their Combat Power values. Tap one of your Pokémon to change up your team, or select**Go Battle** to start your attack.
8. Tap the screen to perform a regular attack, and swipe left or right to dodge incoming attacks. Select the**Charged Attack** button to perform a heavy-hitting attack.  
Charged Attacks build up over time.  
![rival team-owned gym screen, gym battle preparation, battling rival pokÃÂ©mon at a gym](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/yQox3svRJpNHUlhe3m7IGmY-rss=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Gym-battle-50c837dd6915432a988bfcb18dca1340.jpg)
9. When you defeat all of the defending Pokémon, the gym becomes neutral (grey), at which point you can assign your own Pokémon to defend it and claim the gym for your team.

10. Gyms also function much like PokéStops by allowing you to collect items from them.

 Any Pokémon you place at a gym will be unavailable to use in future battles until they return.

##  How to Do Raid Battles in ‘Pokémon Go’ 

 Raid battles are mechanically similar to gym battles, but they take place against one large and very powerful wild Pokémon. Defeating a raid boss (which takes multiple battles and requires help from several other trainers) earns you special rewards and gives you an opportunity to catch the boss Pokémon yourself.  

1. Raids come in different tiers of difficulty, with Tier 1 being the easiest. More difficult raids have tougher bosses and require more trainers to beat.
2. When visiting a gym with an active raid boss, choose**Battle** to start or join a team battle, or select**Private Group** to avoid battling with strangers.
3. Prepare for the raid by tapping**Items** to use items or**Quit** to abandon the battle. Select one of your Pokémon to set up your team.
4. Select**Ready** to let the other participants know you’re set. Keep an eye on the timer at the top of the screen—the battle will begin when it hits zero, whether you’re ready or not.  
![Gym with raid boss, raid battle prep screen, pokÃÂ©mon team setup before a raid](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fKmFjo3OQ8E5YnDNWcvCjXjjMTE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Raid-battle-084c6957caa842cb8274d2d9fd2e640b.jpg)
5. Winning a fight against a raid boss will earn you special Poké Balls that you can use to attempt to catch the boss Pokémon you just defeated. Capturing raid boss Pokémon works the same as regular catching, though it's often more difficult to succeed.  
![fighting a raid boss, earning special pokÃÂ© balls from raid battle, attempting to capture raid boss pokÃÂ©mon](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/4PyQbXpFyXjaSRDw_qV7l8xfbsQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Raid-Battle-2-03184c9960b04c6da76adaa174275a0e.jpg)
6. Raids require**Raid Passes** to participate, which you can earn in a few different ways:  
   * **Regular Raid Passes** : You earn one per day with an inventory limit of one and collect them from a gym just like items from a PokéStop. Use them to access Tier 1 through Tier 5 raids.  
   * **Premium Raid Passes** : You purchase these from the shop using real-world money. They also work for Tier 1-5 raids.  
   * **Remote Raid Passes** : Also in-app purchases using real money. These let you participate in a raid without having to be close to the gym’s real-world location.

 Different raids have different rules and requirements. For example, Remote Raid Passes will not work for Elite Raids—you have to be physically present to take part.

##  Other Tips for ‘Pokémon Go’ 

 There’s more to_Pokémon Go_ than just catching little guys, of course. Here are some other tips and strategies to keep in mind.

* Trade duplicate Pokémon for candy. If you have more than one of the same type of Pokémon, you can trade the "extra" ones for items. Select the**Poké Ball** icon >**Pokémon** \> select the Pokémon you want to exchange, and then go to**Menu** \>**Transfer** .

![The More menu, Transfer command, and confirmation button in PokÃ©mon Go](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vIm_FNL1B4rVJScz7IkSr_1GLck=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Transfer-Pokemon-c9c3209ffe5d4d3399df32b68f9f2b08.jpg) 

* Spend candy and stardust to make your Pokémon stronger. Tap the**Poké Ball** icon > select**Pokémon** \> choose the Pokémon you want to improve. Then, tap**Power Up** and then decide how much to spend improving your Pokémon. Select “**+** ” to use more candy and stardust for a larger boost, and then select**Power Up** again and tap**Yes** to confirm.
* Some Pokémon can Evolved into more powerful forms if you have enough candy saved up. Look for the**Evolve** option right below**Power Up** .
* Hatch eggs you acquire to get even more Pokémon. Tap the**Poké Ball** icon and select**Pokémon** , and then tap the**Eggs** tab. Tap the egg to view its details. Tap**Incubate** and choose an incubator to place the egg in.

 You always have one infinite incubator, but if it’s already got an egg in it you’ll have to either wait or use a one-time use incubator. You can buy more incubators from the in-game shop using real money.

![egg menu, egg details page, choosing an incubator in PokÃ©mon Go](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zYPU23fbDkrE_MRCflCywZ7-WUA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Egg-Hatching-6427e00370b74f478487ad7bec3245c4.jpg) 

* Currently incubating eggs appear in an incubator in the egg list, with the number of km traveled (and km needed to hatch) displayed below them. Move around the real world with the_Pokémon Go_ app open to progress towards hatching your incubated eggs. If Adventure Sync is turned on, distances traveled when the app isn’t open will also be counted.
* Revives are necessary for waking up any Pokémon that have been defeated in battle. Select the Revive item, and then tap on a downed Pokémon to revive it. You can also tap**Revive All** at the bottom of the screen to use multiple revives to wake all of your fainted Pokémon at once—if you have enough items for it.
* Use potions to replenish Pokémon HP lost during battles. Tap the potion item, and then select an injured Pokémon to use it on, or tap**Heal All** at the bottom of the screen to use multiple potions at once.

![Items screen, using a Revive, using a Potion](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Bu9PsSYTjVPNfg97JKMQKsU_5XI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Revive-bb9253eb5dfc4bb5af697305749541b9.jpg) 

 Each Pokémon can only be powered up or evolved using candy from the exact same type of Pokémon. For example, Pikachu can only use Pikachu Candy, Furret requires Furret candy, and so on.
