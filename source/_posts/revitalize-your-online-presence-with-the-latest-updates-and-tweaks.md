[Kindle for PC App Updating Automatially (without permission)](http://www.epubor.com/kindle-for-pc-app-updating-automatially-without-permission.html) \-- 10/24/2020 10:51:45 AM 

Hi Everyone, I've got a Kindle question I'm hoping someone can help with. I use the Kindle for PC app (Australia) to download books I buy so I can back them up. I have cleared the 'automatic update' box, but this morning it still updated without my permission. It will now not let me downgrade, and no matter which version of the app I download, when it is installed it is the current version 1.30\. I'm using Windows 10\.   
 I'm stuck, any suggestions?

[What is the work around for Kindle's latest updated version](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/26/2023 10:25:45 AM 

Amazon requires latest updated version 1.39.2.65383 to be able to download Kindle books to my PC. Epubar gives an error and has prompt to auto-downgrade to version 1.32 because of their inability to crack the code in later versions. I tried this and this work around does not work as Kindle will no longer allow downloads of books in the 1.32 version and requires the update to the 1.39.2.65383 version to be able to do this. As such, what fix/ work around do you have to remedy this issue? 

[Kindle for PC 1.39 Required to Download Books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/12/2023 11:32:39 PM 

Hi,

 Right now Epubor doesn't support Kindle for PC 1.39 yet Amazon is requiring it to download books.

 What are your update plans to keep up with Amazon's new versions?

 Thank you

[after update, epubor won't open](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/16/2021 1:51:04 AM 

Since last week, epubor was failing at converting my files so I found an update. But now it's even worse, epubor won't even open. I deleted the app, downloaded it again, reinstalled it. Same thing. The app won't open anymore.

[Kobo Issues](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/12/2020 4:01:22 AM

 Did something change?

[Ultimate & Kindle Compatibility?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) \-- 3/11/2019 1:49:32 AM 

I get a message when I open my Kindle app on my Mac that my version of the Kindle app (1.17.1) will not be compatible with future updates to MacOS. 

 In the past Ultimate would not convert Kindle books that had been opened by a later version of the Kindle app. Is this still true? Will there be an update to Ultimate to address the new Kindle apps?

 Thanks!

Hello, I have the Epubor Ultimate v3.0.12.412 and I am getting the warning message for the Kindle version is 1.28.0.57030 and it says to downgrade. I followed instructions to de-register, and then download the required file, install, register, turn off automatic update in Kindle before closing. Now, when I close Kindle, and open it, Kindle upgrades itself, even with the "automatic" upgrade is turned off. What's going on? Thanks
