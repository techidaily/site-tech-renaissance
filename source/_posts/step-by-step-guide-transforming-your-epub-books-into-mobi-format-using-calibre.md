Next please follow steps below to start converting eBook format.

#### Step1: Run Calibre and add books to it

We can click "Add books' button at the left navigation bar to add books, or just drag EPUB books from the folder which saves them to the main interface of Calibre. We can see the added books in the middle panel.

#### Step2: Convert EPUB to Mobi

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Then you can see a process of converting at the bottom right corner, when it turns to "Zero", it shows all the books have been converted successfully. Just click "Click to open" to find your converted Mobi files. Then you can [send the converted mobi to Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Note:** One thing I must point out is that every converted file is saved in different folders. If you have converted many EPUB books to Mobi, you may have to open many folders to find all your converted files, which is very inconvenient.

But during the conversion, if you see an alert below, which shows the file is protected with DRM and cannot convert DRMed files, to change EPUB to Mobi file successfully, you'd better remove DRM from EPUB books first and then start conversion.
