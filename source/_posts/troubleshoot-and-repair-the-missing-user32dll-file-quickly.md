In some cases, these errors could indicate a[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

## How to Fix Oleaut32.dll Errors

 Do not download oleaut32.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of the following steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.

1. [Restore oleaut32.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" oleaut32.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to[recover the file with a free data recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
 Undeleting oleaut32.dll is a smart idea only if you're confident you've deleted the file yourself and that it was working properly before you did that.
2. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some oleaut32.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
3. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
4. [Reinstall the program that uses the oleaut32.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the DLL error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.​  
 Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides this file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.
5. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to oleaut32.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file oleaut32.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .​  
 This DLL file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
6. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if the errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
7. [Run the sfc /scannow System File Checker command](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161) to replace a missing or corrupt copy of the file. Since this DLL file is most likely provided by Microsoft, the[System File Checker](https://www.lifewire.com/sfc-command-system-file-checker-2626020) tool should restore it.
8. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other[patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The oleaut32.dll file could be included in one of those updates.
9. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . We've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause oleaut32.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
10. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
11. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair oleaut32.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid oleaut32.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.​  
[We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners](https://www.lifewire.com/registry-cleaner-faq-2625124) , but we've included the option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
12. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This erases everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and installs a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the oleaut32.dll error, this should be your next course of action.​  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during a clean install. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
13. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any of these errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.
