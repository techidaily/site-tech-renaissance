AZW is a proprietary format developed by Amazon. It has its roots in the MOBI format but has better compression and encryption apart from a few more changes. The AZW format has found its place in many platforms with Kindle reading apps apart from Kindle. But AZW files can only be obtained from the Amazon online bookstore. 

**Note: Since now Amazon adopts KFX as the latest ebook format, so if you sync the new purchased KFX books to local computer via Kindle for PC/Mac, the synced books are usually saved in .azw format which actually is a .kfx file. But if you download the same book via Kindle devices, you will get the book with .kfx extension.**

AZW format is DRM (Digital Rights Management) restricted and is locked to the device ID which is registered automatically with the user account of the Kindle purchaser. But DRM free books also carry the AZW extension but they are really no different from MOBI files.

### How to open azw file?

Usually, purchased AZW books comes with DRM protection. So an AZW file you've downloaded can be opened with all the free Kindle apps and devices developed by Amazon.

### How to open azw file on non-Kindle apps and devices

This question equals how to remove DRM from azw books and convert its formats. 

AZW format is DRM restricted and is locked to the device ID which is registered automatically with the user account of the Kindle purchaser. So you need to remove DRM from AZW files before sharing this book with friends. 

Removing DRM from AZW is pretty simple, just make sure the files are synced via Kindle for PC/Mac or connect the Kindle device with computer, then use Epubor Ultimate to handle it.

Step 1Install [the latest Kindle for PC/Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) to your computer and sign in with your Amazon account.

You can click **Decrypted** to find the DRM free AZW file.

### How to edit azw file

Epubor Ultimate can also edit the metadata of decrypted azw file. But if you can't edit some decrypted azw file, then this azw file is definitely a KFX file. There's one limitation about Epubor Ultimate is that it can't edit a KFX file's metadata by now. But the good news is that you can convert azw to epub/azw3/mobi/pdf/txt before editing the metadata. 

You can start editing metadata by clicking the pencil icon to the right of the book title after azw file is converted.

Calibre can edit azw file,too, but KFX files are not included. You can right click the book cover and select **Edit metadata**\>**Edit metadata individually**.

![edit meta calibre](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/edit-meta-calibre.png)

Therefore, Calibre can neither open KFX file nor decrypted azw file(some DRM free azw file are actually kfx file), let alone edit the metadata. But Epubor Ultimate can decrypt DRMed azw files as well as convert formats. And it can also help you eidt the metadata of the decrypted book, including KFX file(you must convert KFX to epub/mobi/pdf/txt before editing metadata). 

**Tips**: If you want to decrypt DRM-protected Kindle AZW books with Calibre, you can read this step-by-step guide about [how to convert Kindle books to EPUB/Mobi/PDF with Calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).
