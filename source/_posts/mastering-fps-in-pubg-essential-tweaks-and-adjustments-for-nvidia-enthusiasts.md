### What to do if the result is not what you expected…

 Sometimes your GPU doesn’t perform as well as you thought it could. To improve this, you should try updating your graphics driver. It won’t significantly improve your GPU performance, but it can help you make the best of its power.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install**Driver Easy** .

**2)** Run**Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button.**Driver Easy** will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
