Ensure both the iPad and printer are on the same network with the same frequency.<br> Most homes only have one Wi-Fi network, but some routers broadcast on a 2.4 GHz network and a 5 GHz network. Large homes may have a Wi-Fi extender that broadcasts on a different network.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-my-ipad-wont-connect-to-wifi-1994546" >Refresh the iPad’s Wi-Fi connection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This procedure forces the iPad to look for the printer again. To refresh Wi-Fi, <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/settings-app-on-ipad-4103785" >open the iPad’s settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , tap<strong>Wi-Fi</strong> and move the green switch to turn Wi-Fi off. Leave it off for a moment and then turn it back on. After the iPad reconnects to the network, try printing again.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-your-ipad-1994495" >Reboot the iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It’s surprising how many random problems rebooting the iPad will solve. Hold down the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ipad-sleep-wake-button-1994354" >Sleep&#x2F;Wake button <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (also referred to as the top or power button) then move the power off slider. After the iPad powers down, press the<strong>top</strong> button again to restart it.<br> Some iPads require you to hold down the top&#x2F;power button and either of the volume buttons.</li><li>Restart the printer. Instead of a problem with the iPad, it could be a problem with the printer. Powering down the printer and powering it back up again could correct problems on the printer side. Wait until the printer has reconnected to the Wi-Fi network before testing it again.<br> Most AirPrint printers have a Wi-Fi light or icon on the display to show that it’s connected properly.</li><li>Verify it’s an AirPrint printer. If this is a new printer, it should say that it’s AirPrint compatible on the packaging. Some older printers use a specific app to print from the iPad, so refer to the owner’s manual. You can see a<a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311" >list of AirPrint printers on Apple’s website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4621764&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/img/page-home.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="If-the-Printer-Appears-in-the-List"><a href="#If-the-Printer-Appears-in-the-List" class="headerlink" title="If the Printer Appears in the List"></a>If the Printer Appears in the List</h2><p> If you can see the printer on your iPad and send print jobs to the printer, it’s probably not an iPad problem. The iPad should detect standard problems like the printer being out of paper or out of ink, but this capability relies on the printer to communicate back with the iPad. Troubleshoot your printer with these steps.</p><ol><li>Check ink levels and paper. You may see an error message indicating that the printer is out of ink. Even if you don’t, rule out these issues by checking that the printer has enough ink and paper.</li><li>Reboot the printer. Any number of things could have gone wrong on the printer’s side, and rebooting it can cure these problems. Power off the printer and leave it off for a few seconds before powering it back on again. After it reboots, try printing again.</li><li>Run diagnostics on the printer. Many printers report basic diagnostics. This procedure checks for ink levels, paper jams, and other common problems.</li><li>Reboot the iPad. The problem shouldn’t be with the iPad if the printer is showing up on it, but reboot the iPad anyway. Hold down the<strong>top</strong> button (and a volume button if necessary) to turn it off, and then hold down the<strong>top</strong> &#x2F;<strong>power</strong> button again to restart it.<br> If a reboot doesn’t work, you may need to try some general<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/basic-ipad-troubleshooting-tips-1994530" >iPad troubleshooting steps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570" >Reboot the router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The problem might not be with the printer. If you checked everything on the printer, it could be the router causing the trouble. Turn the router off and wait at least one minute before booting it back up again to see if that fixes the glitch.</li><li>Contact the printer’s manufacturer. At this point, you’ve gone through the basic troubleshooting steps, including rebooting the iPad, printer, and router. To get more specific troubleshooting steps, contact the printer’s manufacturer.</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-airprint-printers-4143574" >The Best AirPrint Printers of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

More expensive models typically have more features, more premium materials, and greater functionality (e.g., more fitness sensors).  </p><p> The more you spend, the better the smartwatch, but that doesn’t mean that everyone needs to buy a high-end device. That’s why it’s so important to think about what you need from your watch. That way, you can decide how much you can (or are able to) invest.  </p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Price Range</strong></th><th><strong>What You Can Expect</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>$50-$100</td><td>The most basic type of smartwatch.

While some devices can work mostly independently, there are still times when you need to access it via a smartphone app. Simply put, it makes it much easier if the two devices play nicely.  </p><p> If you buy an Apple Watch, it will only work with iPhones, potentially locking you into owning an iPhone for as long as your smartwatch.</p><p> Some Android-based watches will work with your iPhone, but often, not all features will work perfectly.</p><p> You can also consider a third group: smartwatches that aren’t tied to a specific phone maker. These options include Fitbits and Garmin watches as well as other brands like Polar and Suunto, with strong app support for both iOS and Android.</p><h2 id="How-Do-You-Plan-on-Using-Your-Smartwatch"><a href="#How-Do-You-Plan-on-Using-Your-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Plan on Using Your Smartwatch?"></a>How Do You Plan on Using Your Smartwatch?</h2><p> What are your intentions behind buying a smartwatch? Are you tempted by just having new tech, or do you have a specific goal in mind? It’s important to focus on what you want or need most.  </p><p> If you plan on being more active and need the motivation that a smartwatch can provide, look for a smartwatch with training plan functionality, like all Garmin watches. Fitness-minded watches are generally the ideal option if you plan on running a marathon soon, for instance.</p><p> Alternatively, if you just want something that allows you to glance at your wrist throughout the day and feel good about yourself, something from Fitbit can suffice.  </p><p> Finally, you might consider an all-rounder like the Apple Watch and Wear-based devices, which do a bit of everything well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35408920&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro - Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2xI4aMDe_iS79cxcVVcfvcWyMq0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AppleWatchlineup-b20fe549d8374cac9ec8afd8e08118a2.jpg"                      alt="Three Apple Watches in a row.

It’s effectively a form of jewelry, so it’s always going to be on show. That’s why it’s important to find one that suits your personal style. Many smartwatches let you swap out the watch strap, but not all. When it comes to the bezel of the watch, whatever you pick, you’re stuck with.  </p><p> Besides color, you also want to consider size. If you have a small wrist, certain smartwatches can dwarf that and be uncomfortable to wear. Make sure you measure things up carefully so that it looks good on your wrist. Ideally, take the time to try before you buy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631722&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frontpage2-2048x588.webp"                      border="0"                >EmEditor Professional (Lifetime License, non-store app)</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Much-Do-You-Want-to-Customize-your-Smartwatch"><a href="#How-Much-Do-You-Want-to-Customize-your-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do You Want to Customize your Smartwatch?"></a>How Much Do You Want to Customize your Smartwatch?</h2><p> Related to the style of the watch, some smartwatches are more easily customizable than others. Besides some having fixed watch straps, you also need to consider the software side of things. Mostly, all smartwatches allow you to change the watch face, but some brands have better options than others.</p><p> Apple has exclusives like a Snoopy watch face or Disney ones, but they also have ones that will display a ton of information all at once (e.g., weather, calendar, battery level, and the time, of course). Look into available watch faces to make sure you get one that will be useful–or at least appealing–to you.  </p><p> Not all smartwatches allow you to swap out or add more apps, however. In some cases, you may be fine with having a basic selection of apps to choose from. If you can afford a more premium watch, you’ll gain access to app galleries to make your watch more personal and convenient.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Who-Should-Buy-a-Smartwatch"><a href="#Who-Should-Buy-a-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Who Should Buy a Smartwatch?"></a>Who Should Buy a Smartwatch?</h2><p> A few different groups of people benefit most from a smartwatch.  </p><ul><li><strong>Active people</strong> .

Depending on your smartwatch, take a look at the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wear-os-apps-7510805" >best Wear OS apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-apple-watch-fitness-apps-4589822" >best Apple Watch fitness apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . These are great starting points for finding something fun to enrich your experience.</li><li><strong>Pick a new watch face</strong> .

It’s a lot of fun, but if you don’t like wearing anything on your wrist or you’re not interested in checking how fit you are, you don’t need one.</li><li><strong>A fitness tracker may be better</strong> . Fitness trackers perform very similar tasks to a smartwatch, but they tend to lack app support and a few advanced sensors; if you just want basic fitness monitoring, though, they’re a more affordable option.</li><li><strong>Don’t forget the battery life</strong> . Smartwatches have very different battery life. Wear OS and Watch OS-based ones tend to have less time between charges, while Garmin and Fitbit smartwatches can last several days. If you plan on traveling a lot or being active throughout a full day, you may need to consider one with better battery life than average.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Because many companies make Android devices, you must choose a brand and a model.

They also use touch interfaces, including hardware like accelerometers or gyroscopes, for more functions.</p><p> Apple releases a new version of iOS about every fall, with additional updates throughout the year. In the earlier days of Android, updates were less frequent and regular (Android 2.0 came out in 2009, while both 3 and 4 came out in 2011). Recently, however, Android has fallen more into an annual update cycle. Some Android device makers, like Samsung,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-samsung-one-ui-4178405" >use a slightly modified <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> operating system version.</p><p> Some Android makers are slow to update their phones to the latest<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/android-versions-4173277" >version of the Android OS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and sometimes don’t update their phones. Apple typically supports phones for five or six years old, Samsung supports phones for around four years, and Google supports the latest Pixels for seven years.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/play-pc-games-on-iphone-8559383" >How to Play PC Games on iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Apps-Android-Has-More-Options"><a href="#Apps-Android-Has-More-Options" class="headerlink" title="Apps: Android Has More Options"></a>Apps: Android Has More Options</h2><p> iPhone</p><ul><li>Only available through Apple’s App Store (others are supported in the EU).</li><li>Around 2 million apps.</li></ul><p> Android</p><ul><li>Available in the Google Play Store and through third-party sources.</li><li>Around 3 million apps.</li></ul><p> The Apple App Store offers fewer apps than Google Play, but we’re still talking_millions_ of apps, and the selection isn’t the most crucial factor.</p><p> Apple is strict about what apps it allows, while Google’s standards for Android are more relaxed. Apple’s tighter control is part of why its app store has fewer offerings than Google’s, which means you’re less likely to download malware.</p><p> The other benefit of Apple’s centralized storefront is that the company is sure that everything in there is compatible with the available devices. The combination of multiple manufacturers of Android phones and less screening in the Google Play Store means that you may not be sure that an app you want will work with your particular phone.</p><p> That aside, the higher selection and ability to download Android apps outside the official Google Play Store may appeal to some users.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-iPhones-Are-Generally-More-Expensive-Androids-Have-a-Wider-Range-of-Affordability"><a href="#Price-iPhones-Are-Generally-More-Expensive-Androids-Have-a-Wider-Range-of-Affordability" class="headerlink" title="Price: iPhones Are Generally More Expensive; Androids Have a Wider Range of Affordability"></a>Price: iPhones Are Generally More Expensive; Androids Have a Wider Range of Affordability</h2><p> iPhone</p><ul><li>General range: $500 - $1,500+</li></ul><p> Android</p><ul><li>General range: $100 - $1,700+</li></ul><p> Apple positioned the iPhone as a premium device, and the price reflects that. You won’t find a new one for less than $500. Meanwhile, Android-compatible phones are available at a huge range of prices, from around $100 to 20 times that amount.</p><p> While it’s possible to get an Android phone for cheaper, you may get what you pay for. High-end Samsung devices can cost as much or even more than an iPhone if you want a new Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel. At this end of the range, there’s little difference in quality between Android and iPhone. A cheaper Android may be fine if you don’t need a high-tech camera or other features.  </p><p> However, the wide availability of payment plans from Apple, Google, and retailers means you can quickly get an upper-tier phone by paying monthly instead of all at once. These options make price less of an issue.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-or-samsung-which-should-you-buy-4684088" >iPhone vs. Samsung Phone: Which One Should You Buy? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924299/11305" target="_top" id="924299"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924299"                      border="0" alt="" width="520" height="100"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Security-Apple-Keeps-It-Locked-Down"><a href="#Security-Apple-Keeps-It-Locked-Down" class="headerlink" title="Security: Apple Keeps It Locked Down"></a>Security: Apple Keeps It Locked Down</h2><p> iPhone</p><ul><li>Encrypted end-to-end.</li><li>App Store designed to prevent malware.</li></ul><p> Android</p><ul><li>Encrypted end-to-end.</li><li>Wider third-party app availability can open a device to malware.</li></ul><p> If you care about the security of your smartphone, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/reasons-iphone-is-more-secure-than-android-2000308" >iPhone is more secure than the Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The main reason is the operating system’s design.</p><p> Apple controls downloads. One of the most common ways to compromise digital security is by downloading malware – software designed to steal information or affect how a device works.</p><p> Apple works to prevent malware from appearing on its App Store, which is the primary way to get iPhone apps and the_only_ way if you’re not in the EU. In this way, Android’s openness and flexibility can become a liability.</p><p> However, it’s important to note that the iPhone isn’t immune to security threats; it’s less likely to be targeted than Android-based phones.  </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Intelligent-Assistant-Google-Assistant-Beats-Siri"><a href="#Intelligent-Assistant-Google-Assistant-Beats-Siri" class="headerlink" title="Intelligent Assistant: Google Assistant Beats Siri"></a>Intelligent Assistant: Google Assistant Beats Siri</h2><p> iPhone</p><ul><li>Default platform: Siri.</li><li>iPhones can use Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa through apps.</li></ul><p> Android</p><ul><li>Default platforms: Google Assistant or Samsung Bixby.</li><li>Android users can’t use Siri.</li></ul><p> Artificial intelligence and voice interfaces will drive the next frontier of smartphone functionality.

For them, Apple offers a better integrated experience. Because Apple makes computers, tablets, watches, and the iPhone, it provides features that Android may not.</p><p> For example, you can use your iPhone as a remote for your Apple TV. You can also unlock your iPhone or MacBook with an Apple Watch. AirDrop lets you instantly transfer files and links between an iPhone, Mac, or iPad without creating an email.</p><p> Other continuity features let you start a YouTube video on Apple TV and pick it up where you left off on the iPhone. AirPlay can let you share your Mac’s screen with an Apple TV or use an iPad as a second monitor.</p><p> Google’s services, like Gmail, Maps, etc., work across all Android devices. But unless your watch, tablet, phone, and computer are all made by the same company—and there aren’t too many companies other than Samsung that make products in all of those categories—Android has no unified cross-device experience.  </p><h2 id="Serviceability-Get-Android-for-DIY-Fixes"><a href="#Serviceability-Get-Android-for-DIY-Fixes" class="headerlink" title="Serviceability: Get Android for DIY Fixes"></a>Serviceability: Get Android for DIY Fixes</h2><p> iPhone</p><ul><li>Self-repair is difficult, if not impossible.</li><li>You’ll need to take your device to a service provider or Apple Store.</li></ul><p> Android</p><ul><li>Many manufacturers make their devices user-serviceable.</li></ul><p> Apple emphasizes elegance and simplicity in the iPhone above all else.

If you already own Apple products like the Mac, iPad, or Apple TV, getting an iPhone is an easy choice. If flexibility or apps are essential, go for an Android.</p><p> Different categories matter more for certain people. Some will value hardware choice more, while others will care more about battery life or mobile gaming. Both platforms offer good options for different people.

But it depends on your audience, number of followers, and a post’s relative engagement compared to the averages for your account.</p><p> Try these methods to give your content the best chance to go viral on Instagram.</p><p>01</p><p>of 10</p><h2 id="Tailor-Your-Message"><a href="#Tailor-Your-Message" class="headerlink" title="Tailor Your Message"></a>Tailor Your Message</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BzK_OT2FJ1VfLWrQn-dqaTk0FsM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-reply-to-a-specific-message-on-instagram-7bc15dac77674bb58e07e23695cc981b.jpg"                      alt="A woman wearing blue overalls with headphones around her neck holding an iPhone smartphone and checking Instagram messages."                ></p><p>PeopleImages&#x2F;iStock&#x2F;GettyImagesPlus</p><p> This obvious tip isn’t just about your audience’s age and location.

Experiment with hashtags. Popular hashtags don’t guarantee virality, so combine them with niche ones. Lastly, check your posts and see if they have the “surprise” factor.</p><p> Track engagement in the first few hours.

Then, use all the different Instagram storytelling mediums, such as Reels, Stories, and Live sessions. Every little step moves you towards the tipping point for viral posts.</p><p> For instance, Reels are TikTok-style short videos ideal for short attention spans. Add trending audio, effects, and hashtags to make your Reels more discoverable. Publish them at the perfect time with custom Reel covers and captions to hook your audience’s curiosity.</p><p> Stories are a good fit for behind-the-scenes, more casual stuff. The chances of them going viral are lower, as they last only 24 hours. But they are great for experimenting with various content and boosting engagement.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/instagram-live-video-4129154" >Instagram Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an excellent way to make instant connections with your followers.

One of the best things you can do is to post regularly and on schedule. Instagram’s algorithm likes consistency, and your followers will like a consistent voice at a consistent time. Posting too frequently, however, can make Instagram reduce your visibility and reach.</p><p> Too many posts in a short time can fatigue your audience and lead to lower (and low-quality) engagement. Play the patient long game, as Instagram success isn’t instant or guaranteed. Use Instagram’s scheduling tools to balance the frequency of your posts and keep working on their quality.</p><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

You can tie it into any domain name you own, too, so you won’t have to worry about an ugly email address. 10GB storage is a good starting point, too.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.hushmail.com/" >Visit Hushmail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>02</p><p>of 08</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-Security-ProtonMail"><a href="#Best-for-Security-ProtonMail" class="headerlink" title="Best for Security: ProtonMail"></a>Best for Security: ProtonMail</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35408920&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro - Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tnv5yrZdHP6V3DD214wT9cJwssY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/protonmail-a0821c6024ac4e2e9bd95963a1379e2a.jpg"                      alt="Protonmail"                ></p><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>Highly secure.</li><li>Free option.</li><li>Easy to use.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>Paid service has the most features.</li><li>Limited customer support on free service.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/protonmail-review-4107075" >Read our Proton Mail Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Over the years, ProtonMail has built up a reputation for being highly secure. Thanks to its <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-end-to-end-encryption-4028873" >end-to-end encryption <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature and tightened password protection services, it’s often considered one of the most secure ways to send emails.</p><p> For free, you get 500MB of storage space with a limit of 150 messages per day, so the Plus service for a few dollars a month is superior. With the paid service, you can set up folders, labels, custom filters, and better customer support. Whatever you choose, though, ProtonMail is very secure. With a priority on security, you won’t have to worry about anyone accessing your emails. Even ProtonMail itself can’t read them.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://proton.me/mail" >Visit ProtonMail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>03</p><p>of 08</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-iOS-users-iCloud-Mail"><a href="#Best-for-iOS-users-iCloud-Mail" class="headerlink" title="Best for iOS users: iCloud Mail"></a>Best for iOS users: iCloud Mail</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BHiwlyHk-M4sbqOMRwleoipP-As=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/icloud-ce0a705caea7492d8c62bc63d6fba5cf.jpg"                      alt="iCloud"                ></p><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>Apple users already have an account.</li><li>Easy to use.</li><li>Free.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>Not available to Android users.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/icloud-mail-review-1172292" >Read our iCloud Mail review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Own an iPhone or Mac? You almost certainly already have an iCloud email address from signing up for various services. The iCloud.com domain name could be more exciting, but it is free and convenient. The interface looks like a simpler version of Gmail, making it all the easier to use. That’s reflected in its features, which include no mention of solid encryption or anything more than the basics.</p><p> You only get 5GB of free iCloud storage, but it’s a decent plan entirely for free.

Its interface is straightforward, making it perfect for novices and those who want to send a few emails. It integrates with Windows well, so it’s an endearing product for an extensive Windows user.

It only has 5GB of storage, which isn’t the lowest here, but it still could be better. Also, you can only send files up to 5MB in size.

It’s a relatively small monthly fee, depending on how much storage space you want, but it means you won’t be using this as a throwaway account. A free trial means you can try it out, and we love the minimalist themes involved.

They mean you to wear it all day, and it focuses particularly on sleep tracking. It has three sensors: an accelerometer, a photo-based cell to read heart rate, and one that measures your skin temperature.</p><p> The big change for the Galaxy Watch Ultra is the programmable Fast Button, which you can use to quickly start a workout or do other tasks. Both watches include gesture controls that let you do things like turn off phone alarms or take pictures with a double-tap of your fingers.</p><p> The Galaxy Buds come in two types. The main difference is that the regular Galaxy Buds 3 are an open type (the buds sit against your ear canal), while the Buds 3 are canal-type (the buds fit inside your ear canal). Both versions have dynamic equalization and noise-canceling, along with 24-bit audio, but only the Buds 3 Pro have a two-way speaker.</p><p> The foldable devices–the Flip 6 and Fold 6–continue the company’s dedication to artificial intelligence with new photo editing and generation features.

There are, however, several different reasons that could individually show up as a performance issue in Windows 11.</p><p> Any of the following could be to blame:</p><ul><li>Too many programs are actively running</li><li>One or more apps are hogging all the memory</li><li>You’re running too low on free storage space</li><li>The OS or a device driver contains an unresolved bug</li><li>There’s an issue with your connection to the internet</li><li>Your hardware can’t keep up</li></ul><p> Those things could produce the following symptoms (this is not an exhaustive list):</p><ul><li>Programs take a long time to open (or never open at all)</li><li>Nothing works for several minutes after logging in to Windows</li><li>Menus or windows don’t feel as snappy as they should</li><li>Delayed mouse or keyboard actions</li><li>Downloads stall or web pages don’t fully finish loading</li><li>Choppy audio or video streaming</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-fast-does-your-pc-need-to-be-832310" >How Fast Does Your PC Really Need to Be? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872496/14483" target="_top" id="1872496"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872496"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="625"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872496/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Fix-Windows-11-Running-Slow"><a href="#How-to-Fix-Windows-11-Running-Slow" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix Windows 11 Running Slow"></a>How to Fix Windows 11 Running Slow</h2><p> Since there are so many potential reasons Windows is slow, there are several angles from which to address it.

However,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/why-does-restarting-seem-to-fix-most-computer-problems-2624569" >restarting does fix many computer problems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and is often a quick fix for a slow computer.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596" >Install Windows updates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , if any are available. Bugs can cause performance issues, and the only way to fix OS-level bugs is through<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-windows-update-2624597" >Windows Update <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .<br> If your PC’s issue is actually that Windows Update itself is slow, see<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/when-windows-update-gets-stuck-or-frozen-2624439" >what to do when Windows Update gets stuck or frozen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/remove-junk-files-from-windows-11-5191868" >Delete junk files <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Depending on how you use your computer and how often you clear out these kinds of files, there could be a_lot_ you can erase.<br> Junk files are easy to overlook as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/things-taking-up-space-on-your-pc-5223487" >something that takes up too much space on your PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If you have a lot, they could collectively be taking up so much storage that your hard drive is running too low on free space.<br> Or, depending on where the files are, they might be clogging up one or more apps’ abilities to work normally and thus presenting as a slow computer. This is often the case with a web browser’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-cache-2483171" >cache <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .<br> Deleting the biggest apps on your computer can free up lots of space. Remember, however, that unless your hard drive is quite full (90% or more), deleting a program_just_ to free up space probably won’t impact performance all that much.</li><li>Shut down services or apps you don’t need to use right now. The best way to do this is with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/task-manager-2626025" >Task Manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

But, just clicking<strong>X</strong> doesn’t always do it. Some things are slowing down Windows because they’re still running in the background.<br><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fix-high-cpu-usage-in-windows-11-5216242" >How to Fix High CPU Usage in Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/change-startup-programs-windows-11-6823499" >Disable unnecessary startup apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . These are programs that start automatically with Windows. You don’t_need_ this to happen for most programs because you can just open them manually when you need to use them.<br> If you have lots of programs trying to launch at once, you’ll feel the sluggishness each time your computer starts. Plus, if you don’t shut them down later, they’ll continue to hog up memory and other essential resources.</li><li>Disable unnecessary visual effects that could be impacting performance.<br> Windows 11 shows animations when opening and closing windows, but they can be turned off if they’re affecting performance. Go to<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt;<strong>Visual effects</strong> , and disable<strong>Animation effects</strong> .<br> We also recommend changing the Performance Options visual effects setting to<strong>Adjust for best performance</strong> (alternatively, pick and choose which effects to disable from that screen). You can find that option by executing this command from Run (<strong>WIN+R</strong> ) or Windows Search:<br> <code>SystemPropertiesPerformance</code></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fix-search-not-working-in-windows-11-5191397" >Troubleshoot Windows 11 Search not working <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , if by “slow computer,” you really just mean_searches_ are slow.

Find Out How to Restore Typing Functionality in Minutes</h2><p> This article explains how to fix an unresponsive keyboard.

Here are some solutions we’ve seen work:  </p><ol><li>Make sure you have the correct text field selected. Click directly in the section where you want to type, then try typing again.<br> This is an easy mistake to make. Watch where you’ve clicked to ensure the keystrokes are sent there. The app must be in focus or what you type won’t show up in the right place.</li><li>Close and reopen the app you’re trying to type in. Temporary software glitches happen all the time, and restarting the program is the fastest way around them.</li><li>Turn on the keyboard if it has an on&#x2F;off switch. If it’s on and is battery-powered, check the batteries or ensure it’s at least somewhat charged.</li><li>Check the keyboard’s connection to your computer. We recommend doing the following, depending on the keyboard you have:  <ul><li>For a USB keyboard, unplug it and plug it back in.  </li><li>For a wireless one, detach the USB dongle for a few seconds and then reattach it.  </li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/turn-on-bluetooth-in-windows-11-5216193" >Toggle Bluetooth off on your PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and then switch it back on, making sure your keyboard connects after a few seconds. You may need to <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-a-bluetooth-device-2640340" >pair the keyboard again <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if it doesn’t.  </li><li>Plug the keyboard or dongle into a different USB port.  </li><li>Try a different cable if it uses a detachable USB cable.  </li><li>Try it on a different computer. If it doesn’t work there, it’s likely dead.<br><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/important-keyboard-features-2640341" >5 Things to Consider When Buying a Computer Keyboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568" >Restart your computer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Dirt stuck under the keys can keep them from working correctly. This could be why some keys work but others don’t.<br> If you find sticky residue under the keys, it may have failed due to spilled liquid. Cleaning may help, and you can sometimes even<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/steps-to-laptop-spill-repair-2378134" >save a laptop keyboard after a spill <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but it’s also possible it’s been permanently damaged.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-device-manager-2626075" >Open Device Manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and enable the keyboard.

A driver installation is almost always necessary if you have an advanced keyboard that hasn’t been able to type right out of the box. However, even older keyboards that used to type just fine could use a driver update if the existing one was deleted or needs a bug fix.<br> If your keyboard stopped working after an update, you may need to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217" >roll back your driver <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-off-sticky-keys-windows-4692841" >Disable sticky and filter keys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

If you’re in this situation, we’ve 10 tips that can resolve the majority of iPhone email problems. Read on to learn about each one.</p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/check-network-connection-status-of-wireless-devices-818268" >Check iPhone network connection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Your iPhone can’t get an email if it’s not connected to the internet. You need to be connected to a cellular network like a 4G LTE network through your phone company or a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-cant-connect-to-wifi-fix-1999602" >Wi-Fi network <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to access email.<br> To connect to a cellular network, tap<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Cellular</strong> &gt; and move the<strong>Cellular Data</strong> slider to off&#x2F;white and then back to on&#x2F;green.<br><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/save-time-and-money-using-wifi-817904" >To connect to a Wi-Fi connection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , turn on Wi-Fi in the iPhone Settings.<br> It’s also smart to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-iphone-airplane-mode-2000238" >make sure Airplane Mode isn’t turned on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Airplane mode can block connections to cellular and Wi-Fi networks.</li><li>Check email username and password. If your email isn’t sending or downloading, it could be that there’s a problem with the username and&#x2F;or password for that email account. In that situation, it’s most likely that you’ll get a pop-up window asking you to enter your username or password again.<br> If you don’t get that pop-up, you may want to remove the email account from your phone and set it up again. Check out the section on how to do that later in this article.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/quit-apps-on-iphone-2000287" >Close the app and relaunch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . One quick way to fix an app that’s not working as expected is to quit the app and relaunch it. This may solve some problems that cause Mail not to work. When the Mail app is closed, tap the<strong>Mail</strong> app again to relaunch it.</li><li>Check email settings. Email accounts on the iPhone can be set to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/make-iphone-mail-check-for-new-mail-less-often-or-never-1172558" >check email on a schedule <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (every 30 minutes, for example) or to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-do-iphone-email-settings-do-2000086" >have mail pushed to your device as soon as it arrives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The settings you choose impact how your email arrives on your phone.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restart-iphone-2000288" >Restart the iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If your Internet connection is good, your settings fine, and you’ve restarted the Mail app, your next step is a common iPhone-troubleshooting measure: restarting your phone. Believe it or not, restarting an iPhone can solve tons of problems. Sometimes your phone just needs a fresh start.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-iphones-operating-system-2000293" >Up <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-iphones-operating-system-2000293" >date iOS using iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-ios-on-iphone-connecting-itunes-1999188" >update iOS without iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Another key troubleshooting step is to make sure you have the latest version of the iOS. Updated versions of the iOS deliver bug fixes and improvements to features. It’s possible that the problems with your email are the result of a bug that’s fixed with the latest iOS update or that your email provider has changed some settings and only the latest iOS version works with the change.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/delete-email-account-from-iphone-4136941" >D <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/delete-email-account-from-iphone-4136941" >elete the email account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/delete-email-account-from-iphone-4136941" >from your iPhone, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> then<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/add-email-account-to-iphone-4582835" >add the account to your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> again. If none of these steps have helped and you’re still having iPhone email problems, there may not be anything wrong with your phone. Instead, the problem may be the settings you’re using. If you entered the wrong server address, username, or password when setting up the account on your phone, you won’t be able to get email. If that’s the case, delete the email account.<br> With the email account deleted from your phone, double check all the settings that you should use to access this account. Then go through the process of adding the email account to your iPhone again.</li><li>Contact your email provider for support. If your email still isn’t working, it’s time to get some direct tech support for your email problems. A good first step is to check with your email provider (Google for Gmail, Yahoo for Yahoo Mail, etc.). Each email provider has different ways to provide support, but a good bet is to log into your email account on the web and then look for links like Help or Support.</li><li>Get help directly from Apple. If your email provider can’t help, you may have a problem that’s bigger or more complex than you can solve. In that case, it’s probably best to take your iPhone — and all of the information about the email account — to your nearest Apple Store for tech support (you can also call Apple for support). Apple Stores are busy places, though, so<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/make-apple-store-appointment-with-app-1999600" >make an appointment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before heading out to make sure you get help.</li><li>If it’s a work account, check with your IT department. If you’re trying to check a work email account, it may be that the problem doesn’t lie with your iPhone at all. The problem might reside on the email server that you’re trying to get email from.<br> A temporary problem with that server or a configuration change that you’re not aware of could block your iPhone’s access. If the account that’s not working is provided by your job, check with your company’s IT department and see if they can help resolve the problem.</li></ol><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Samsung showed off plenty of interesting news at the launch, but here are some of our favorites:</p><ul><li><strong>Translation</strong> : The Live Translate feature automatically translates between 13 languages in text messages and phone calls.

This update makes low-light photos look better.</li><li><strong>Titanium</strong> : Apple used titanium for the iPhone 15 Pro, and now it’s Samsung’s turn. This material is tough, light, and looks great.

If you can’t answer calls on a Samsung Galaxy Watch, there may be a connectivity problem, the watch may not be configured correctly, or you may need to add it to your mobile plan.  </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4621764&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/img/page-home.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Fix-it-When-You-Can’t-Answer-Calls-on-a-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch"><a href="#How-to-Fix-it-When-You-Can’t-Answer-Calls-on-a-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix it When You Can’t Answer Calls on a Samsung Galaxy Watch"></a>How to Fix it When You Can’t Answer Calls on a Samsung Galaxy Watch</h2><p> Perform each of the following troubleshooting steps in the order presented (easiest to most involved) for your best chances of success.  </p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/restart-samsung-galaxy-watch-5217412" >Restart your Galaxy Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Restarting will not delete anything, and it takes only a minute or so to finish up. It’s a great first step for pretty much any tech problem.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/connect-samsung-galaxy-watch-to-phone-5217958" >Confirm you’ve connected your Galaxy Watch to your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The phone and watch must be connected via Bluetooth. Without pairing your phone properly, you won’t be able to answer calls.<br> Be sure you’ve enabled Bluetooth on your paired phone. Without Bluetooth on, you can’t connect your watch and phone, and therefore can’t answer calls.</li><li>Check that your watch is near your phone. If you don’t have LTE, your devices must be close together for you to answer calls (within about 30 feet).<br> If you can answer calls when the watch and phone are really close, there may be radio interference in the area that’s preventing a connection when they’re further apart. That, or it’s a problem with your phone’s Bluetooth radio.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/receive-text-messages-on-samsung-galaxy-watch-5217923" >Turn on notifications on your Galaxy Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You may have inadvertently disabled notifications. In the Galaxy Wearable app on your phone, go to<strong>Watch settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Notifications</strong> , and ensure you’ve turned on call notifications.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00082122/" >Verify that your watch has LTE service, if applicable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In the Galaxy Wearable go, go to<strong>Watch settings</strong> or<strong>Home</strong> &gt;<strong>Mobile plans</strong> . This option is only available if you’ve activated the watch with your cellphone carrier. If you haven’t done that yet, contact your carrier for more information.<br> If you have an LTE-enabled Galaxy Watch, you can answer calls without your phone once you purchase and activate a cellular plan for your watch.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00087245/" >Change the watch band if it’s metal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This material may cause interference, leading to disconnected calls.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-do-not-disturb-on-android-4688870" >Check the Do Not Disturb settings on your phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You can access the Goodnight, Bed Time, and Theater modes in the watch’s Advanced or Quick settings. If any of these modes are on, turn them off and check to see if you can answer calls.</li><li>Check your phone’s Bluetooth connectivity. Try using your phone with other Bluetooth devices in various locations. If it works in some areas but not others, you’re probably dealing with interference.<br> If your phone has poor Bluetooth range wherever you go, you may need to repair or replace the phone.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/is-galaxy-watch-waterproof-4774452" >Check if Water Lock is on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If you’ve accidentally turned on Water Lock, you won’t be able to answer calls on your watch until you turn it off. To turn off Water Lock, press-and-hold the<strong>home&#x2F;power</strong> button until it switches off.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/connect-bluetooth-devices-to-iphone-2000092" >Double-check Bluetooth settings if using an iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If you’re using your Galaxy Watch with an iPhone, your phone might display an error the first time you try to make a call from the watch. If so, open your iPhone Bluetooth settings, and you’ll see a second Galaxy Watch listed in the available devices. Connect to that, and you’ll be able to send and receive calls.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/support/mobile/wearables/smartwatches/galaxy-watch/" >Contact Samsung Galaxy Watch support. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> If none of these solutions work, check with Samsung’s tech support to see if there’s another issue.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Causes-of-Not-Being-Able-to-Answer-Calls-on-a-Galaxy-Watch"><a href="#Causes-of-Not-Being-Able-to-Answer-Calls-on-a-Galaxy-Watch" class="headerlink" title="Causes of Not Being Able to Answer Calls on a Galaxy Watch"></a>Causes of Not Being Able to Answer Calls on a Galaxy Watch</h2><p> When you can’t answer calls on a Samsung Galaxy Watch, there are several potential causes.
