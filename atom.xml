And for the most part, that’s exactly what’s happened with the OnePlus Pad. </p><p>This Android-powered tablet has month-long battery standby, along with impressive daily battery life. Cipriani reviewed this tablet and found it quick and snappy for daily tasks like checking your email, playing games or browsing the web, all on a display that looks fantastic. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/oneplus-pad-review/"><strong>OnePlus Pad</strong></a></p><p>“One aspect of the overall experience I enjoyed using was the multitasking features built into OxygenOS, the operating system the Pad runs, Cipriani wrote. “More specifically, I found myself frequently using a quick gesture on the display to effectively split the display in half, putting one app on the left side of the screen and a second on the other half. A two-finger swipe down from the top of the screen was all it took.”</p><p>OnePlus also sells a keyboard case and a stylus for the OnePlus Pad, which more or less turns the OnePlus Pad into an iPad Pro dupe. However, verified customers who have bought and used this tablet say online that trackpad gestures and navigation are finicky, and a lot of the same interface features – such as the mouse pointer – on the OnePlus Pad come straight from Apple’s iPadOS interface for the same feature. </p><p><strong>OnePlus Pad specs: Display</strong>: 11.61-inch, 144Hz refresh rate, LCD 2,800x2,000 display | <strong>Processor</strong>: MediaTek Dimensity 9000 Mobile Platform | <strong>Storage</strong>: 128GB | <strong>Memory</strong>: 8GB | <strong>Colors</strong>: Halo green | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 13MP rear. 8MP front camera | <strong>Weight</strong>: 555 grams | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 189.41 x 258.03 x 6.54mm | <strong>Connections</strong>: USB-C | <strong>Battery:</strong> 9,510mAh</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KP9KCLS/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cd5fd3efe-7b87-4c34-aa89-e9536b8a8534%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/microsoft-surface-go-3-10-5-touch-screen-intel-pentium-gold-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-device-only-latest-model-platinum/6478762.p?skuId=6478762&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-go-3/904H27D0CBWN/2L0C?OCID=AID2200065" >View now at Microsoft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Windows Hello</li><li>Lots of ports</li><li>Up to 256GB storage</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Can only install apps from Microsoft Store in Windows 10 S Mode</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105869/7443" target="_top" id="2105869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Microsoft-Surface-Go-3"><a href="#Microsoft-Surface-Go-3" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft Surface Go 3"></a>Microsoft Surface Go 3</h2><h3 id="Best-compact-Windows-tablet"><a href="#Best-compact-Windows-tablet" class="headerlink" title="Best compact Windows tablet"></a>Best compact Windows tablet</h3><p>The design hasn’t changed for the Go 3, meaning it should work with all of the original accessories, including the Type Cover keyboard.

It’s a small tablet, with a display of just 10.5 inches, but it runs the full Windows operating system that you can customize.</p><p>It can also run Windows 10 in S Mode, which limits you to installing apps from only the Microsoft Store, along with a few other security features. But you can opt for the full Windows 10 experience by leaving S Mode.</p><p>One <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/18j7qxn/my%5Fnewto%5Fme%5Fsurface%5Fgo%5F3/" >Reddit user <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> praised the Surface Go 3, saying, “No issues running a bunch of Edge tabs, Excel, Word, and PP docs all at the same time,” adding, “Even media consumption is way easier on the Go 3.”</p><p><strong>Microsoft Surface Go 3 tech specs: Display</strong>: 10.5-inch PixelSense Display | <strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Pentium Gold or Intel Core i3 | <strong>Storage</strong>: 64GB or 256GB | <strong>Memory</strong>: 4GB or 8GB | <strong>Biometrics</strong>: Windows Hello face sign-in | <strong>Colors</strong>: Platinum | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 8MP rear, 1080p video. 5MP front facing camera | <strong>Weight</strong>: 1.07 pounds | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 9.65 x 6.9 x 0.33 inches | <strong>Connections</strong>: 1 x USB-C, 3.5mm headphone jack, 1 x Surface Connect Port, microSD card reader | <strong>Battery life:</strong> 11 hours</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cd5fd3efe-7b87-4c34-aa89-e9536b8a8534%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1826768-REG/apple%5Fmvv93ll%5Fa%5F11%5Fipad%5Fpro%5Fwifi.html/BI/23252/KBID/28790/SID/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp" >View now at B&amp;H Photo-Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?prodsku=5495363&u=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252F-%252F5495363.p%253Fcmp%253DRMX&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Tandem OLED display gets plenty bright</li><li>M4 processor is fast, reliable, and for everyone</li><li>Strongest accessory ecosystem yet</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>iPadOS still feels inconsistent and limited</li><li>Accessories are expensive but almost mandatory</li></ul><h2 id="Apple-iPad-Pro-7th-generation"><a href="#Apple-iPad-Pro-7th-generation" class="headerlink" title="Apple iPad Pro (7th generation)"></a>Apple iPad Pro (7th generation)</h2><h3 id="Best-laptop-replacement-tablet"><a href="#Best-laptop-replacement-tablet" class="headerlink" title="Best laptop replacement tablet"></a>Best laptop replacement tablet</h3><p>Apple’s 2024 iPad Pro lineup is by far the most capable and impressive iPad lineup we’ve seen, and it makes replacing your laptop with a tablet an easy decision. The design is much slimmer than previous Pro models, and you’ll find Apple’s powerful M4 processor. This chip consists of a new 10-core GPU, next-generation machine learning accelerators to handle a diverse range of tasks, and ProMotion technology, enabling variable screen refresh rates ranging from 10 to 120Hz.</p><p>Wan spent some time with the 13-inch Apple iPad Pro and was especially impressed by the new Tandem OLED screen. “In practice, Tandem OLED makes the iPad Pro a phenomenal tablet for visual experiences. I’ve been able to complete text-heavy and photo-editing work – which often require adequate viewing angles – under a New York City sun that thinks it’s already summer,” Wan wrote in his review. “Watching Netflix and Disney+ on the iPad is straight eye candy; colors pop, and the darker, moodier scenes have a level of shadow detail unseen on older Pro models.”</p><p><strong>Review: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-review/" >Apple iPad Pro (7th generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The Pro also supports the new <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX2D3AM/A/apple-pencil-pro" >Apple Pencil Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a range of features, including a squeeze gesture for quick tool, color, and other changes, a gyroscope for precise control of pens and brush tools with a simple rotation, and custom haptic feedback that you can feel via a pulse.

You move it by double tapping in the blank space on either side of it.”</p><p>Not only is the app experience better with the Pixel Tablet, but it pulls double duty acting as a smart home hub when it’s not in use thanks to the included Charging Speaker Dock. The $129 accessory (if you want to buy extras) has a built-in speaker that ups the bass by 4x, while enabling a hub mode feature that effectively makes the Pixel Tablet more like a Nest Hub, instead of a tablet. </p><p>Unfortunately, right now, there isn’t any sort of official keyboard or stylus for those who want to get some work done on the Pixel Tablet.

The 6th-generation iPad Air keeps the same design we saw Apple bring to the Air in late 2022, but it now boasts an M2 processor, two size choices (11 inches or 13 inches), and compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro.</p><p>The Apple iPad Air still sits confidently between the base iPad and the iPad Pro when you look at the price, but it’s effectively caught up to the iPad Pro in terms of performance. Apple says you’ll get up to 50% better performance than in the previous model and much faster graphics performance for gaming or video editing. And, the big draw of the iPad Pro was always its bigger size, but that benefit has now come downmarket to a price tier that’s much more accessible.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-air-2024-review/"><strong>Apple iPad Air (6th generation)</strong></a></p><p>Another standout feature is the iPad Air’s front-facing camera, which has been rotated to the side bezel for landscape mode, which means you’ll look a lot better during FaceTime calls.</p><p>Where the iPad Pro is the model for those who want nothing but the best, the iPad Air is the model for those who want to use the tablet for work and play, without big sacrifices in performance or features.

If so, then a Fire tablet or the base model iPad is going to be more than enough for you. </p><p>However, if you want to use a tablet more like a laptop, then you’ll want to consider the iPad Pro, or one of the Surface devices. Here is a decision matrix that can help you choose which tablet is right for you: </p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Choose this tablet…</strong></th><th><strong>If you want or are…</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple iPad (10th gen)</td><td>The best overall option when it comes to power, storage, and user-friendliness. The Apple iPad is the best tablet for anything.</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon Fire HD 10</td><td>An affordable tablet with basic features great for streaming. If you’re looking to spend less on a tablet, this is a great pick.</td></tr><tr><td>Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</td><td>An Android tablet with expandable storage up to 1TB. This is Samsung’s best tablet–and largest–tablet, by far.</td></tr><tr><td>OnePlus Pad</td><td>The best Android tablet for entertainment and daily tasks like checking your email and browsing the web.</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft Surface Go 3</td><td>A compact tablet for travel and mobile work. One of the best parts about this tablet is that it has A LOT of ports.</td></tr><tr><td>Apple iPad Pro (7th gen)</td><td>A tablet to replace your laptop thanks to its powerful Apple M4 chip. All you need to add is an attachable keyboard, and you have a device as powerful as the MacBook Pro.</td></tr><tr><td>Google Pixel Tablet</td><td>Google’s Pixel Tablet is one of the best Android tablets on the market.

When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.</p><ul><li><strong>Display</strong>: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy.<br>We also compare the display’s performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen’s responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer’s stylus.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet’s temperature during intensive tasks.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.</li><li><strong>Camera and audio:</strong> For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.</li></ul><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tablet testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><h2 id="What-does-it-mean-if-a-tablet-is-Wi-Fi-only"><a href="#What-does-it-mean-if-a-tablet-is-Wi-Fi-only" class="headerlink" title="What does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only?"></a>What does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only?</h2><p>When a tablet says it is “Wi-Fi Only,” it requires a wireless internet connection to access things like email, websites, and apps. There are models available that give you the option to use LTE cellular data to connect to the internet, but if you aren’t planning on traveling with your tablet, you can stick to a Wi-Fi only model.</p><h2 id="Is-a-tablet-better-than-a-laptop"><a href="#Is-a-tablet-better-than-a-laptop" class="headerlink" title="Is a tablet better than a laptop?"></a>Is a tablet better than a laptop?</h2><p>That depends on what you want to use your tablet or laptop for. Digital artists tend to prefer tablets since they’re easier to draw on with a stylus. Tablets are also great for photo editing and streaming movies if you get one with a large enough screen size. But if you want to do things like create spreadsheets, type in a word processing program, or do intensive 3D animation or modeling, you’re better off with a laptop.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-tablet-for-students"><a href="#What-is-the-best-tablet-for-students" class="headerlink" title="What is the best tablet for students?"></a>What is the best tablet for students?</h2><p>Our top pick for the best tablet for students is the 10th-generation iPad, thanks to its affordable price and versatility of use. However, we’d also recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ or the Microsoft Surface Pro 9 for students looking to buy a tablet. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-tablets-for-students/"><strong>The best tablets for students going back to school</strong></a></p><h2 id="Are-there-alternative-tablets-worth-considering"><a href="#Are-there-alternative-tablets-worth-considering" class="headerlink" title="Are there alternative tablets worth considering?"></a>Are there alternative tablets worth considering?</h2><p>Of course, the tablet market is more than just these 10 picks above.

A two-finger swipe down from the top of the screen was all it took.”</p><p>OnePlus also sells a keyboard case and a stylus for the OnePlus Pad, which more or less turns the OnePlus Pad into an iPad Pro dupe. However, verified customers who have bought and used this tablet say online that trackpad gestures and navigation are finicky, and a lot of the same interface features – such as the mouse pointer – on the OnePlus Pad come straight from Apple’s iPadOS interface for the same feature. </p><p><strong>OnePlus Pad specs: Display</strong>: 11.61-inch, 144Hz refresh rate, LCD 2,800x2,000 display | <strong>Processor</strong>: MediaTek Dimensity 9000 Mobile Platform | <strong>Storage</strong>: 128GB | <strong>Memory</strong>: 8GB | <strong>Colors</strong>: Halo green | <strong>Cameras</strong>: 13MP rear. 8MP front camera | <strong>Weight</strong>: 555 grams | <strong>Dimensions</strong>: 189.41 x 258.03 x 6.54mm | <strong>Connections</strong>: USB-C | <strong>Battery:</strong> 9,510mAh</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KP9KCLS/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cd0eb0ee0-3209-4d5d-a00d-8cff18958604%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/microsoft-surface-go-3-10-5-touch-screen-intel-pentium-gold-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-device-only-latest-model-platinum/6478762.p?skuId=6478762&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-go-3/904H27D0CBWN/2L0C?OCID=AID2200065" >View now at Microsoft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Windows Hello</li><li>Lots of ports</li><li>Up to 256GB storage</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Can only install apps from Microsoft Store in Windows 10 S Mode</li></ul><h2 id="Microsoft-Surface-Go-3"><a href="#Microsoft-Surface-Go-3" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft Surface Go 3"></a>Microsoft Surface Go 3</h2><h3 id="Best-compact-Windows-tablet"><a href="#Best-compact-Windows-tablet" class="headerlink" title="Best compact Windows tablet"></a>Best compact Windows tablet</h3><p>The design hasn’t changed for the Go 3, meaning it should work with all of the original accessories, including the Type Cover keyboard.

I’ve been able to complete text-heavy and photo-editing work – which often require adequate viewing angles – under a New York City sun that thinks it’s already summer,” Wan wrote in his review. “Watching Netflix and Disney+ on the iPad is straight eye candy; colors pop, and the darker, moodier scenes have a level of shadow detail unseen on older Pro models.”</p><p><strong>Review: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-review/" >Apple iPad Pro (7th generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The Pro also supports the new <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX2D3AM/A/apple-pencil-pro" >Apple Pencil Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a range of features, including a squeeze gesture for quick tool, color, and other changes, a gyroscope for precise control of pens and brush tools with a simple rotation, and custom haptic feedback that you can feel via a pulse.

You move it by double tapping in the blank space on either side of it.”</p><p>Not only is the app experience better with the Pixel Tablet, but it pulls double duty acting as a smart home hub when it’s not in use thanks to the included Charging Speaker Dock. The $129 accessory (if you want to buy extras) has a built-in speaker that ups the bass by 4x, while enabling a hub mode feature that effectively makes the Pixel Tablet more like a Nest Hub, instead of a tablet. </p><p>Unfortunately, right now, there isn’t any sort of official keyboard or stylus for those who want to get some work done on the Pixel Tablet.

The 6th-generation iPad Air keeps the same design we saw Apple bring to the Air in late 2022, but it now boasts an M2 processor, two size choices (11 inches or 13 inches), and compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro.</p><p>The Apple iPad Air still sits confidently between the base iPad and the iPad Pro when you look at the price, but it’s effectively caught up to the iPad Pro in terms of performance. Apple says you’ll get up to 50% better performance than in the previous model and much faster graphics performance for gaming or video editing. And, the big draw of the iPad Pro was always its bigger size, but that benefit has now come downmarket to a price tier that’s much more accessible.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-air-2024-review/"><strong>Apple iPad Air (6th generation)</strong></a></p><p>Another standout feature is the iPad Air’s front-facing camera, which has been rotated to the side bezel for landscape mode, which means you’ll look a lot better during FaceTime calls.</p><p>Where the iPad Pro is the model for those who want nothing but the best, the iPad Air is the model for those who want to use the tablet for work and play, without big sacrifices in performance or features.

Some are better for kids, others are simply for artists, and then there’s the mini laptop for working professionals and students. We considered a variety of use-cases to match virtually every need.</li><li><strong>Price points:</strong> Tablets are an expensive piece of tech, especially if you’re planning on investing in compatible accessories or buying for your kids to inevitably drop at a moment’s notice,</li><li><strong>Integrations with other products:</strong> We considered options that can work with a smart case, attachable keyboard, Apple Pencil, or Stylus, and other work and entertainment add-ons.</li><li><strong>Battery life:</strong> Whether you’re using your tablet for work or play (or both), you’ll want it to last the duration of your task.</li></ul><h2 id="How-we-test-tablets"><a href="#How-we-test-tablets" class="headerlink" title="How we test tablets"></a>How we test tablets</h2><p>The ZDNET team chose all of the tablets included in this list based on their performance when <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tested in the real world <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.</p><ul><li><strong>Display</strong>: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy.<br>We also compare the display’s performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen’s responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer’s stylus.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet’s temperature during intensive tasks.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.</li><li><strong>Camera and audio:</strong> For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.</li></ul><p>For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/" >tablet testing methodology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><h2 id="What-does-it-mean-if-a-tablet-is-Wi-Fi-only"><a href="#What-does-it-mean-if-a-tablet-is-Wi-Fi-only" class="headerlink" title="What does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only?"></a>What does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only?</h2><p>When a tablet says it is “Wi-Fi Only,” it requires a wireless internet connection to access things like email, websites, and apps. There are models available that give you the option to use LTE cellular data to connect to the internet, but if you aren’t planning on traveling with your tablet, you can stick to a Wi-Fi only model.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136614/26400" target="_top" id="2136614">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136614" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136614/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-a-tablet-better-than-a-laptop"><a href="#Is-a-tablet-better-than-a-laptop" class="headerlink" title="Is a tablet better than a laptop?"></a>Is a tablet better than a laptop?</h2><p>That depends on what you want to use your tablet or laptop for. Digital artists tend to prefer tablets since they’re easier to draw on with a stylus. Tablets are also great for photo editing and streaming movies if you get one with a large enough screen size. But if you want to do things like create spreadsheets, type in a word processing program, or do intensive 3D animation or modeling, you’re better off with a laptop.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-tablet-for-students"><a href="#What-is-the-best-tablet-for-students" class="headerlink" title="What is the best tablet for students?"></a>What is the best tablet for students?</h2><p>Our top pick for the best tablet for students is the 10th-generation iPad, thanks to its affordable price and versatility of use. However, we’d also recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ or the Microsoft Surface Pro 9 for students looking to buy a tablet. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-tablets-for-students/"><strong>The best tablets for students going back to school</strong></a></p><h2 id="Are-there-alternative-tablets-worth-considering"><a href="#Are-there-alternative-tablets-worth-considering" class="headerlink" title="Are there alternative tablets worth considering?"></a>Are there alternative tablets worth considering?</h2><p>Of course, the tablet market is more than just these 10 picks above.

Top brands like Kobalt and Craftsman, as well as smaller brands like Worx, have added electric leaf blowers to their outdoor power tool lines, so you can tackle autumn clean-up chores with ease.</p><h3 id="See-also"><a href="#See-also" class="headerlink" title="See also"></a>See also</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-electric-mower/" >The 5 best electric lawn mowers: Top alternatives to gas-powered By using either a rechargeable battery or extension cord, you can ditch the gas can for a greener way to care for your lawn.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Electric leaf blowers use either batteries or extension cords for power, though I recommend battery-powered models since electrical cables are less maneuverable and potentially dangerous in wet weather. Plus, electric leaf blowers don’t require engine maintenance, so no need to worry about fuel mix or engine oil – you’ll have more time to actually get work done. </p><p>To help you decide which option is right for you, I’ve rounded up the best electric leaf blowers available on the market right now. ZDNET experts analyzed their features and price points so you can find the best fit for your budget and needs.

The entire unit is lightweight and easy to use, featuring a variable speed trigger, trigger lock for continuous use, and turbo button for blasting away wet or stubborn debris. I use my leaf blower to clear grass clippings after I mow the lawn, and this leaf blower does an excellent job of handling heavy, wet debris, even without turbo mode.</p><p>On a full charge, the Kobalt 40V Max runs for 40 minutes, which is about a month’s worth of clearing leaves from your driveway, sidewalk, and patio. Plus, the leaf blower uses the same 40V Max batteries as other Kobalt-branded outdoor equipment, so you don’t have to buy special batteries. </p><p>The Kobalt 40V Max has a top air speed of 110 miles per hour and can move 480 cubic feet of air per minute (cfm). That means you can clear away everything from wet leaves and fresh grass clippings to fallen acorns and small sticks. The result? Your driveway, sidewalks, and outdoor entertaining areas will look brand new. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QGNPNP9?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d1bfe4b-3513-4e03-9b91-6590c68baad7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RNDQCV3?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d1bfe4b-3513-4e03-9b91-6590c68baad7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Ego Power+ variable speed electric leaf blower Best battery electric leaf blower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Ego Power+</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>90-minute run-time</li><li>Battery and charger included</li><li>200mph&#x2F;765cfm</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Slightly Heavy</li><li>15-minute run-time in Turbo Mode</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p><strong>Battery size:</strong> 56V | <strong>Run time:</strong> 90 minutes | <strong>Weight:</strong> 12.25lbs | <strong>Wind speed:</strong> 200mph | <strong>Air volume:</strong> 765cfm | <strong>Charger and battery included:</strong> Yes </p><p>Battery-powered lawn equipment can get a bad reputation for limited run-time, but the Ego Power+ 56V cordless leaf blower features the most impressive battery life on the market. When used on the lowest setting, this leaf blower runs for up to 150 minutes, so you can clear an entire lawn of dried leaves and grass clippings. On high power settings, you’ll still get an average run-time of 90 minutes, which is plenty of time to clear your sidewalks, driveway, and outdoor entertainment areas.</p><p>This Ego Power+ model reaches a wind speed of 200mph and air volume of 765 cubic feet per minute (cfm), so you can handle wet and stubborn debris. The handle and trigger have an ergonomic design for comfortable use. While the tool weighs just over 12 pounds, making it one of the heavier models on the market, it’s still easy to use.

The end of the nozzle also features an integrated scraper for loosening stubborn and wet debris. The rear of the unit also has an integrated hanging hook for convenient storage in your crowded garage or shed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08W2K3V9R?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d1bfe4b-3513-4e03-9b91-6590c68baad7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079LC6RHW?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d1bfe4b-3513-4e03-9b91-6590c68baad7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Milwaukee M18 Fuel electric leaf blower Best splurge electric leaf blower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Milwaukee</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Lightweight and ergonomic design</li><li>Great air speed and volume</li><li>Battery included</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>No charger included</li><li>Short run-time</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p><strong>Battery size:</strong> 18V | <strong>Run time:</strong> 20 minutes | <strong>Weight:</strong> 5lbs | <strong>Wind speed:</strong> 120mph | <strong>Air volume:</strong> 450cfm | <strong>Charger and battery included:</strong> Battery only </p><p>Milwaukee is a big name in power tools, offering high-end products for both DIYers and trade professionals. The M18 Fuel 18V cordless leaf blower uses the same M18 battery as other Milwaukee products, so loyalists can easily add this yardwork tool to the rotation. The motor and fan provide up to 120mph air speed and 450cfm air volume, allowing you to quickly clear leaves, grass clippings, and other debris from your walkways and yard.</p><p>The ergonomic handle, variable speed trigger, and trigger lock make the leaf blower comfortable and easy to use. Plus, the entire unit weighs just 5 pounds, so you won’t get exhausted when clearing stubborn debris from a larger yard. The brushless motor has been upgraded from previous versions, reaching full throttle in under a second. You can spend less time fighting with your leaf blower and more time getting work done. </p><p>It also comes with a battery so you can get started immediately, or maintain it as a backup for other Milwaukee M18 system tools. On a full charge using low to medium settings, you’ll get about 20 minutes of run-time out of this leaf blower – you’ll clear away fallen leaves in no time.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079LC6RHW?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d1bfe4b-3513-4e03-9b91-6590c68baad7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.ryobitools.com/products/details/46396036926" >Ryobi 40V Whisper electric leaf blower Best heavy-duty electric leaf blower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Ryobi</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Extremely quiet</li><li>Excellent air speed and volume</li><li>Turbo mode button</li><li>Two batteries and charger included</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Heavy</li><li>Limited run-time</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p><strong>Battery size:</strong> 40V | <strong>Run time:</strong> 20 minutes | <strong>Weight:</strong> 10lbs | <strong>Wind speed:</strong> 190mph | <strong>Air volume:</strong> 730cfm | <strong>Charger and battery included:</strong> Yes</p><p>The Ryobi 40V Whisper cordless electric leaf blower is an excellent option if you have endless leaves to blow or live in a wet climate that makes debris more difficult to clear. It reaches a top air speed of 190 mph and air volume of 730cfm, allowing you to blast away wet and stuck-on debris from your driveway, walkways, and outdoor entertaining areas. If you need even more power, the turbo mode button boosts air speed and volume. However, you will get significantly less turbo run-time than the 20 minutes Ryobi advertises. </p><p>The Ryobi 40V Whisper also features an ergonomic handle, variable speed trigger, and trigger lock, which makes operating the 10-pound leaf blower easy and comfortable. This model comes with two batteries and a charger, so you can get to work right away, keeping the backup battery handy if you need to blow leaves for an extended period of time. It also uses the same 40V batteries as other Ryobi Whisper products, so you can integrate the leaf blower into your tool rotation if you’re a Ryobi brand loyalist. The brushless motor has been updated for the Whisper Series as well, making the leaf blower 7x quieter than previous Ryobi models.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.ryobitools.com/products/details/46396036926" >View now at Ryobi Tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/c/159047/456723/8154?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-40V-HP-Brushless-Whisper-Series-190-MPH-730-CFM-Cordless-Battery-Jet-Fan-Leaf-Blower-with-2-4-0-Ah-Batteries-Charger-RY404100VNM/314600140&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at The Home Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>more buying choices </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2002018/7443" target="_top" id="2002018">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2002018" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2002018/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-best-electric-leaf-blower"><a href="#What-is-the-best-electric-leaf-blower" class="headerlink" title="What is the best electric leaf blower?"></a>What is the best electric leaf blower?</h2><p>My pick for the best electric leaf blower is the Kobalt 40V Max cordless model. It’s an updated version of the model I personally use for lawn care and yard chores. The ergonomic handle and cruise control switch make continuous use easy and comfortable. And the turbo button gives you extra power for clearing wet and stuck-on debris. It also uses the same 40V Max batteries as other Kobalt electric tools, meaning you won’t have to worry about maintaining a special battery.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Electric leaf blower</strong></th><th><strong>Price</strong></th><th><strong>Air Speed &#x2F; Volume</strong></th><th><strong>Run time</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Kobalt 40V Max</td><td>$104</td><td>110mph &#x2F; 480cfm</td><td>40 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Ego Power+ 56V handheld</td><td>$329</td><td>200 mph &#x2F; 765cfm</td><td>90 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Craftsman 20V Max handheld</td><td>$89</td><td>90 mph &#x2F; 200cfm</td><td>20 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Milwaukee M18 Fuel cordless</td><td>$319</td><td>120 mph &#x2F; 450cfm</td><td>20 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Ryobi 40V Whisper</td><td>$329</td><td>190 mph &#x2F; 730cfm</td><td>20 minutes</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006919/19272" target="_top" id="2006919">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006919" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006919/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-is-the-right-electric-leaf-blower-for-you"><a href="#Which-is-the-right-electric-leaf-blower-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Which is the right electric leaf blower for you?"></a>Which is the right electric leaf blower for you?</h2><p>When shopping for an electric leaf blower, you want to choose a model that offers a balance of battery life, air speed, and air volume. If you have a larger yard or lots of outdoor entertainment space, you’ll want a model with a long run-time, high air volume, and high air speed to handle both dry and wet debris. If you only need to clear your walkways occasionally or have a small yard, a less powerful model will suit your needs.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Choose this electric leaf blower</strong> <strong>…</strong></th><th><strong>If you need…</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Kobalt 40V Max 480cfm</td><td>A well-rounded electric leaf blower for general yardwork</td></tr><tr><td>Ego Power+ 765cfm</td><td>A powerful electric leaf blower with a long run-time</td></tr><tr><td>Craftsman 20V Max 200cfm</td><td>A budget friendly, battery-powered leaf blower</td></tr><tr><td>Milwaukee M18 Fuel 450cfm</td><td>A high-end electric leaf blower</td></tr><tr><td>Ryobi 40V Whisper 730cfm</td><td>A powerful electric leaf blower for endless leaves</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137209/26400" target="_top" id="2137209">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137209" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137209/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-electric-leaf-blowers"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-electric-leaf-blowers" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these electric leaf blowers?"></a>How did we choose these electric leaf blowers?</h2><p>When analyzing options, I chose battery-powered electric leaf blowers for their power and ease of use. Battery-powered leaf blowers are safer to use than models that require an extension cord, especially if you have a large yard where unwieldy electrical cables could get damaged. I also chose both budget-friendly and high-end models that suit different climates and types of debris.</p><h2 id="Is-an-electric-leaf-blower-worth-it"><a href="#Is-an-electric-leaf-blower-worth-it" class="headerlink" title="Is an electric leaf blower worth it?"></a>Is an electric leaf blower worth it?</h2><p>They absolutely can be! Not only does an electric leaf blower eliminate harmful exhaust emissions, but it also means you don’t have to worry about engine maintenance or mixing oil and fuel. Electric leaf blowers are also comparable to gas models in terms of power, offering you the same capability for clearing debris from your walkways, driveway, and outdoor spaces, without the hassle of a gas engine.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948932/19272" target="_top" id="1948932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-more-important-in-a-leaf-blower-Cubic-feet-per-minute-or-miles-per-hour"><a href="#What-is-more-important-in-a-leaf-blower-Cubic-feet-per-minute-or-miles-per-hour" class="headerlink" title="What is more important in a leaf blower: Cubic feet per minute or miles per hour?"></a>What is more important in a leaf blower: Cubic feet per minute or miles per hour?</h2><p>Both factors are equally important. Decent wind speed and air volume are both needed to clear debris quickly and efficiently. A leaf blower that offers high air speed but low volume will handle dry leaves and grass clippings well enough, but won’t be able to clear wet or stuck-on debris. And a leaf blower that has a high air volume but low speed won’t have enough power to clear away anything.</p><h2 id="Are-electric-leaf-blowers-more-powerful-than-gas"><a href="#Are-electric-leaf-blowers-more-powerful-than-gas" class="headerlink" title="Are electric leaf blowers more powerful than gas?"></a>Are electric leaf blowers more powerful than gas?</h2><p>Unfortunately, no. But electric leaf blowers have come a long way since they first hit the market, with most brands offering models just as powerful as gas models. </p><p>Also, battery-powered electric leaf blowers have more power than models that require extension cords, since they have brushless motors for efficient power consumption and operation. </p><h2 id="Are-there-alternative-electric-leaf-blowers-worth-considering"><a href="#Are-there-alternative-electric-leaf-blowers-worth-considering" class="headerlink" title="Are there alternative electric leaf blowers worth considering?"></a>Are there alternative electric leaf blowers worth considering?</h2><p>If you’re in the market for an electric leaf blower, there are tons of models to choose from.

We don’t know yet, and Apple likely doesn’t even have all the answers itself. “Apple aims to make this solution available by fall 2025,” the document read. The company is also working on a solution for exporting and importing browser data into another browser on the same device. The browser data solution, Apple says, will be available later this year or early 2025.</p><p>Browsing social media comments on this change, the consensus is that moving from iOS to Android can be challenging right now, especially with password transfer and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-is-bringing-end-to-end-encryption-to-icloud-backups-heres-what-it-means/" >iCloud data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. For the most part, people report, Google facilitates the move from <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-envy-five-ios-17-features-that-android-users-already-have/" >Android to Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a lot more easily, including a special “Move to iOS” app available in the Play Store.</p><p>Google does have a “Switch to Android” app for iOS, but it only moves the most important of things like contacts, photos and videos, messages, and calendars. Less critical but still valuable things are missing.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-i-sideload-apps-on-iphone-without-jailbreaking/" >Can I sideload apps on my iPhone without jailbreaking? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Android is never specifically named in the document, but it’s clear that’s the focus when Apple mentions “different operating system.”</p><p>If you haven’t been following things in Europe, new EU laws recently went into effect that potentially have big implications for Apple. These new laws are aimed at all tech giants, and are designed to open doors for competition.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-refuses-to-relax-its-iron-grip-on-iphones-in-europe/" >Apple refuses to relax its iron grip on iPhones in Europe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>While it’s not clear exactly what Apple will be doing, it sounds like it will be providing tools so other developers can make data-transfer apps. The announcement document mentions that whatever solution the company develops would assist other mobile operating system providers make solutions for data transfer across different operating systems.</p><h4 id="Apple"><a href="#Apple" class="headerlink" title="Apple"></a>Apple</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-hands-on/"  title="iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you&#39;ll get">iPhone 16 Pro upgrade: If you have a 3 year-old iPhone, here are all the new features you’ll get <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ios-18-settings-i-changed-immediately-and-why-you-should-too/"  title="6 iOS 18 settings I changed immediately -

Top brands like Kobalt and Craftsman, as well as smaller brands like Worx, have added electric leaf blowers to their outdoor power tool lines, so you can tackle autumn clean-up chores with ease.</p><h3 id="See-also"><a href="#See-also" class="headerlink" title="See also"></a>See also</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-electric-mower/" >The 5 best electric lawn mowers: Top alternatives to gas-powered By using either a rechargeable battery or extension cord, you can ditch the gas can for a greener way to care for your lawn.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Electric leaf blowers use either batteries or extension cords for power, though I recommend battery-powered models since electrical cables are less maneuverable and potentially dangerous in wet weather. Plus, electric leaf blowers don’t require engine maintenance, so no need to worry about fuel mix or engine oil – you’ll have more time to actually get work done. </p><p>To help you decide which option is right for you, I’ve rounded up the best electric leaf blowers available on the market right now. ZDNET experts analyzed their features and price points so you can find the best fit for your budget and needs. Plus, we explain how leaf blowers work to inform your decision-making process.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/yard-outdoors/best-electric-pressure-washer/"><strong>The best electric pressure washers</strong></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QGNPNP9?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d1bfe4b-3513-4e03-9b91-6590c68baad7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Kobalt 40V Max cordless electric leaf blower Best electric leaf blower overall <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Kobalt</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>40-minute run-time</li><li>Lightweight design</li><li>Turbo button and cruise control</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Battery and charger not included</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p><strong>Battery size:</strong> 40V | <strong>Run time:</strong> 40 minutes | <strong>Weight:</strong> 5.5lbs | <strong>Wind speed:</strong> 110mph | <strong>Air volume:</strong> 480cfm | <strong>Charger and battery included:</strong> No </p><p>The Kobalt 40V Max electric leaf blower is the latest version of the model I personally use, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. The entire unit is lightweight and easy to use, featuring a variable speed trigger, trigger lock for continuous use, and turbo button for blasting away wet or stubborn debris. I use my leaf blower to clear grass clippings after I mow the lawn, and this leaf blower does an excellent job of handling heavy, wet debris, even without turbo mode.</p><p>On a full charge, the Kobalt 40V Max runs for 40 minutes, which is about a month’s worth of clearing leaves from your driveway, sidewalk, and patio. Plus, the leaf blower uses the same 40V Max batteries as other Kobalt-branded outdoor equipment, so you don’t have to buy special batteries. </p><p>The Kobalt 40V Max has a top air speed of 110 miles per hour and can move 480 cubic feet of air per minute (cfm). That means you can clear away everything from wet leaves and fresh grass clippings to fallen acorns and small sticks. The result? Your driveway, sidewalks, and outdoor entertaining areas will look brand new. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QGNPNP9?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d1bfe4b-3513-4e03-9b91-6590c68baad7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RNDQCV3?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d1bfe4b-3513-4e03-9b91-6590c68baad7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Ego Power+ variable speed electric leaf blower Best battery electric leaf blower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Ego Power+</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>90-minute run-time</li><li>Battery and charger included</li><li>200mph&#x2F;765cfm</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Slightly Heavy</li><li>15-minute run-time in Turbo Mode</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p><strong>Battery size:</strong> 56V | <strong>Run time:</strong> 90 minutes | <strong>Weight:</strong> 12.25lbs | <strong>Wind speed:</strong> 200mph | <strong>Air volume:</strong> 765cfm | <strong>Charger and battery included:</strong> Yes </p><p>Battery-powered lawn equipment can get a bad reputation for limited run-time, but the Ego Power+ 56V cordless leaf blower features the most impressive battery life on the market. When used on the lowest setting, this leaf blower runs for up to 150 minutes, so you can clear an entire lawn of dried leaves and grass clippings. On high power settings, you’ll still get an average run-time of 90 minutes, which is plenty of time to clear your sidewalks, driveway, and outdoor entertainment areas.</p><p>This Ego Power+ model reaches a wind speed of 200mph and air volume of 765 cubic feet per minute (cfm), so you can handle wet and stubborn debris. The handle and trigger have an ergonomic design for comfortable use. While the tool weighs just over 12 pounds, making it one of the heavier models on the market, it’s still easy to use.

The brushless motor has been upgraded from previous versions, reaching full throttle in under a second. You can spend less time fighting with your leaf blower and more time getting work done. </p><p>It also comes with a battery so you can get started immediately, or maintain it as a backup for other Milwaukee M18 system tools. On a full charge using low to medium settings, you’ll get about 20 minutes of run-time out of this leaf blower – you’ll clear away fallen leaves in no time.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079LC6RHW?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d1bfe4b-3513-4e03-9b91-6590c68baad7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.ryobitools.com/products/details/46396036926" >Ryobi 40V Whisper electric leaf blower Best heavy-duty electric leaf blower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Ryobi</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Extremely quiet</li><li>Excellent air speed and volume</li><li>Turbo mode button</li><li>Two batteries and charger included</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Heavy</li><li>Limited run-time</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p><strong>Battery size:</strong> 40V | <strong>Run time:</strong> 20 minutes | <strong>Weight:</strong> 10lbs | <strong>Wind speed:</strong> 190mph | <strong>Air volume:</strong> 730cfm | <strong>Charger and battery included:</strong> Yes</p><p>The Ryobi 40V Whisper cordless electric leaf blower is an excellent option if you have endless leaves to blow or live in a wet climate that makes debris more difficult to clear. It reaches a top air speed of 190 mph and air volume of 730cfm, allowing you to blast away wet and stuck-on debris from your driveway, walkways, and outdoor entertaining areas. If you need even more power, the turbo mode button boosts air speed and volume. However, you will get significantly less turbo run-time than the 20 minutes Ryobi advertises. </p><p>The Ryobi 40V Whisper also features an ergonomic handle, variable speed trigger, and trigger lock, which makes operating the 10-pound leaf blower easy and comfortable. This model comes with two batteries and a charger, so you can get to work right away, keeping the backup battery handy if you need to blow leaves for an extended period of time. It also uses the same 40V batteries as other Ryobi Whisper products, so you can integrate the leaf blower into your tool rotation if you’re a Ryobi brand loyalist. The brushless motor has been updated for the Whisper Series as well, making the leaf blower 7x quieter than previous Ryobi models.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.ryobitools.com/products/details/46396036926" >View now at Ryobi Tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/c/159047/456723/8154?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-40V-HP-Brushless-Whisper-Series-190-MPH-730-CFM-Cordless-Battery-Jet-Fan-Leaf-Blower-with-2-4-0-Ah-Batteries-Charger-RY404100VNM/314600140&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at The Home Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>more buying choices </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148643/16836" target="_top" id="2148643">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148643" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="75"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148643/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-best-electric-leaf-blower"><a href="#What-is-the-best-electric-leaf-blower" class="headerlink" title="What is the best electric leaf blower?"></a>What is the best electric leaf blower?</h2><p>My pick for the best electric leaf blower is the Kobalt 40V Max cordless model. It’s an updated version of the model I personally use for lawn care and yard chores. The ergonomic handle and cruise control switch make continuous use easy and comfortable. And the turbo button gives you extra power for clearing wet and stuck-on debris. It also uses the same 40V Max batteries as other Kobalt electric tools, meaning you won’t have to worry about maintaining a special battery.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Electric leaf blower</strong></th><th><strong>Price</strong></th><th><strong>Air Speed &#x2F; Volume</strong></th><th><strong>Run time</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Kobalt 40V Max</td><td>$104</td><td>110mph &#x2F; 480cfm</td><td>40 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Ego Power+ 56V handheld</td><td>$329</td><td>200 mph &#x2F; 765cfm</td><td>90 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Craftsman 20V Max handheld</td><td>$89</td><td>90 mph &#x2F; 200cfm</td><td>20 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Milwaukee M18 Fuel cordless</td><td>$319</td><td>120 mph &#x2F; 450cfm</td><td>20 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Ryobi 40V Whisper</td><td>$329</td><td>190 mph &#x2F; 730cfm</td><td>20 minutes</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135374/19272" target="_top" id="2135374">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135374" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135374/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-is-the-right-electric-leaf-blower-for-you"><a href="#Which-is-the-right-electric-leaf-blower-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Which is the right electric leaf blower for you?"></a>Which is the right electric leaf blower for you?</h2><p>When shopping for an electric leaf blower, you want to choose a model that offers a balance of battery life, air speed, and air volume. If you have a larger yard or lots of outdoor entertainment space, you’ll want a model with a long run-time, high air volume, and high air speed to handle both dry and wet debris. If you only need to clear your walkways occasionally or have a small yard, a less powerful model will suit your needs.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Choose this electric leaf blower</strong> <strong>…</strong></th><th><strong>If you need…</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Kobalt 40V Max 480cfm</td><td>A well-rounded electric leaf blower for general yardwork</td></tr><tr><td>Ego Power+ 765cfm</td><td>A powerful electric leaf blower with a long run-time</td></tr><tr><td>Craftsman 20V Max 200cfm</td><td>A budget friendly, battery-powered leaf blower</td></tr><tr><td>Milwaukee M18 Fuel 450cfm</td><td>A high-end electric leaf blower</td></tr><tr><td>Ryobi 40V Whisper 730cfm</td><td>A powerful electric leaf blower for endless leaves</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-electric-leaf-blowers"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-electric-leaf-blowers" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these electric leaf blowers?"></a>How did we choose these electric leaf blowers?</h2><p>When analyzing options, I chose battery-powered electric leaf blowers for their power and ease of use. Battery-powered leaf blowers are safer to use than models that require an extension cord, especially if you have a large yard where unwieldy electrical cables could get damaged. I also chose both budget-friendly and high-end models that suit different climates and types of debris.</p><h2 id="Is-an-electric-leaf-blower-worth-it"><a href="#Is-an-electric-leaf-blower-worth-it" class="headerlink" title="Is an electric leaf blower worth it?"></a>Is an electric leaf blower worth it?</h2><p>They absolutely can be! Not only does an electric leaf blower eliminate harmful exhaust emissions, but it also means you don’t have to worry about engine maintenance or mixing oil and fuel. Electric leaf blowers are also comparable to gas models in terms of power, offering you the same capability for clearing debris from your walkways, driveway, and outdoor spaces, without the hassle of a gas engine.</p><h2 id="What-is-more-important-in-a-leaf-blower-Cubic-feet-per-minute-or-miles-per-hour"><a href="#What-is-more-important-in-a-leaf-blower-Cubic-feet-per-minute-or-miles-per-hour" class="headerlink" title="What is more important in a leaf blower: Cubic feet per minute or miles per hour?"></a>What is more important in a leaf blower: Cubic feet per minute or miles per hour?</h2><p>Both factors are equally important. Decent wind speed and air volume are both needed to clear debris quickly and efficiently. A leaf blower that offers high air speed but low volume will handle dry leaves and grass clippings well enough, but won’t be able to clear wet or stuck-on debris. And a leaf blower that has a high air volume but low speed won’t have enough power to clear away anything.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129041/19576" target="_top" id="2129041">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129041" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129041/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-electric-leaf-blowers-more-powerful-than-gas"><a href="#Are-electric-leaf-blowers-more-powerful-than-gas" class="headerlink" title="Are electric leaf blowers more powerful than gas?"></a>Are electric leaf blowers more powerful than gas?</h2><p>Unfortunately, no. But electric leaf blowers have come a long way since they first hit the market, with most brands offering models just as powerful as gas models. </p><p>Also, battery-powered electric leaf blowers have more power than models that require extension cords, since they have brushless motors for efficient power consumption and operation. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036481/19272" target="_top" id="2036481">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036481" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036481/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-there-alternative-electric-leaf-blowers-worth-considering"><a href="#Are-there-alternative-electric-leaf-blowers-worth-considering" class="headerlink" title="Are there alternative electric leaf blowers worth considering?"></a>Are there alternative electric leaf blowers worth considering?</h2><p>If you’re in the market for an electric leaf blower, there are tons of models to choose from.

While it was already good for holding my debit card, work badge, and other incidentals, I’ve found it to be a solid addition to my MagSafe accessory lineup because it gives me options. </p><p>I don’t often keep my driver’s license or credit card in my phone wallet while going to work, but I like that I have the option if I need or want to for another event or activity. </p><p>The Ezmo wallet has storage for four cards on the inside and one on the front. </p><p>Kayla Solino&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>I recently used the Ezmo wallet while road tripping by car, and it was a game-changer. It stored my top four cards on the go, eliminating the need to rummage through my car for my purse every time I stopped. You can even remove this wallet from your phone and use it like a regular one, and no one would question it. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The phone stand makes this wallet top-notch. It makes it easy to prop up my phone at the office or at home in portrait or landscape mode. I even found myself using the back half of the wallet as a makeshift grip on the train, which added extra stability. It’s great for taking pictures, too! </p><p>The Ezmo wallet (bottom center) stacked with other MagSafe wallets I’ve tested. </p><p>Kayla Solino&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The magnetic connection rivals that of other top-tested picks, like the Satechi wallet.

This MagSafe charger features 15W charging, offers a stand component for my iPhone 14 Pro, charges all of my Apple devices at once, and folds up easily for quick transport and storage. It also comes with a wall adapter, which isn’t always a guarantee. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-found-a-qi2-charging-station-that-can-do-it-all-and-apple-users-will-love-it/"><strong>I found a Qi2 charging station that can do it all (and Apple users will love it)</strong></a></p><p>I first purchased this Anker charger after ZDNET’s Sabrina Ortiz tested it in March of last year. I was looking for a safe and functional 3-1 charger that would also cut down the amount of cords I needed to pack while traveling. This is it. Unveiled at CES 2023, this 3-1 is truly worth your money if you own an Apple Watch and a pair of AirPods too and want a great charger for at home and on the go. Ortiz said that the charging speed on this charger is comparable to individual cords with respective wall adapters, even when charging simultaneously. “Whether I was charging one device or three, I noticed that the devices were charging at a comparable speed to when I normally had them plugged into their respective wall chargers,” she said in her review. </p><p>I can concur based on my personal use, too. This stand charges up all of my devices quickly, and I love how easy it is to pack up to take on a trip. I’ve personally taken this charger in carry-on bags on the plane, and in travel bags in the car, and it makes setting up your charging station at a hotel that much easier. You’re also never going to forget a charging cable ever again, because all you need is this little device. </p><p>Even though this Anker charger is on the pricier side, costing $110, it’s worth it thanks to its function and duality. It also frequently goes on sale during Amazon events, dropping to $88 (save $22). Compared to other options on this list, I think this 3-1 pick offers immense value because it can be used at home or on the go with ease, especially if you can grab it on sale. </p><p>Verified Amazon customers give this Anker charger a 4.6&#x2F;5 stars and said they liked the compactness and convenience of this design as well as the easy to use setup, foldability, and magnetic strength. However, some customers said the simultaneous charging wasn’t consistent. </p><p><em>Author’s Note: The Anker MagGo 3-1 charger is on sale for $88 (save $22) at Amazon upon the latest publication.</em> </p><p><strong>Anker MagGo 3-1 Wireless Charging Station features</strong>: <strong>Compatability</strong>: iPhone (any with MagSafe), Wireless Earbuds, Apple Watch | <strong>Color:</strong> White or Black | Foldable | Easy for travel | Comes with wall adapter </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1252926&u=4338022&m=83231&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https://bluettifr.pxf.io/bax2bv" >View now at Courant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Works with several devices</li><li>“Luxury” color and material options</li><li>Aesthetic</li><li>Wall adapter included</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Must double check device is placed correctly to charge</li><li>No watch charging option for Apple</li><li>Movement can disrupt charge</li><li>Pricey for only 2-1 charging</li></ul><h2 id="Courant-Catch-2-Wireless-Charger"><a href="#Courant-Catch-2-Wireless-Charger" class="headerlink" title="Courant Catch 2 Wireless Charger"></a>Courant Catch 2 Wireless Charger</h2><h3 id="Best-Android-and-Apple-wireless-charger-for-aesthetics"><a href="#Best-Android-and-Apple-wireless-charger-for-aesthetics" class="headerlink" title="Best Android and Apple wireless charger for aesthetics"></a>Best Android and Apple wireless charger for aesthetics</h3><p>The Courant Catch 2 is designed to charge through most cases up to 3mm in thickness with Qi-certified technology. Courant says it offers “multi-device wireless charging, without any of the drawbacks of ‘dead-zones’.” </p><p>This charger has made its way across many of my social media feeds over the years, and I have always been intrigued by the blend of style and function. I was happy to finally test some of Courant’s products and was overall impressed with the aesthetic appearance and charging capabilities. While this isn’t the fastest charger on the market, it’s not designed to be so. Rather, Courant has chosen to focus on making tech beautiful, which in the accessory category, isn’t a pillar of many competitors. The Catch 2 is truly one of the most appealing and beautiful mobile accessories I have ever used, and for that alone is worthy of praise. </p><p>But what’s more is that it does charge well. This comfortably charged my iPhone 14 Pro and my AirPods Pro 2 with ease, and they looked quite nice while doing so. Even the included wall adapter and cord carry the carefully thought-out aesthetics of the charging pad, matching perfectly in color. This charging pad is only a 2-1 option but is compatible with more smartphone options than our top pick (you can wirelessly charge any device that supports wireless charging). The only negative I experienced as an iPhone user is the lack of MagSafe technology (though keep in mind this wasn’t designed to include a magnetic grip), because it does take extra effort to check to make sure my devices are in fact charging when I place them on the pad. They also can easily be disrupted by charging with movement, as I discovered when my cats began jumping on tables. Of course, there’s no Apple Watch charger on this pad either. </p><p>That said, if you’re looking for a beautiful yet functional charger for your living space, bedroom, or “drop zone” area of your home, this Courant charger fits the bill. It comes in both linen and leather options with several color choices, each to fit your style perfectly. If you’re a MagSafe maestro, Courant does offer a MagSafe wireless charging tray option that is designed to charge an iPhone and a pair of AirPods at the same time, but not in this specific design iteration, and it will cost you a bit more. </p><p>The Catch 2 charger has a 4&#x2F;5 star ranking on Courant’s website, and customers said that they liked the overall design and aesthetic appeal of this charger, as well as the numerous color options. One customer even said it was the missing piece in their office: “This might be the best tech equipment I’ve gotten since my AirPods. Sleek design with high functionality, this was the missing link in my office. Looks beautiful on my dark desk - gorgeous contrast.” However, some customers said this version wasn’t ideal for charging two iPhones wirelessly and that without a magnetic connection, you must be vigilant about placing your devices down to ensure they charge.</p><p><strong>Courant Catch 2 Wireless Charger features</strong>: <strong>Compatability</strong>: Any phone with wireless charging, Wireless Earbuds | <strong>Color:</strong> Camel, Charcoal, Natural (Linen) or Saddle, Black, Cortado, Ash, or Bone (Leather) | Comes with wall adapter | Aesthetic design </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.qdossound.com/products/snapstand-3-in-1-wireless-charger-space-grey" >View now at QDOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Stand feature</li><li>3-1 charging</li><li>Unique, flat-fold design</li><li>Easy for travel</li><li>Standby mode compatible</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>No color options</li><li>Pricier compared to other 3-1 options</li><li>No wall adapter included</li><li>iPhone only</li></ul><h2 id="Qdos-SnapStand-3-1-Wireless-Charger"><a href="#Qdos-SnapStand-3-1-Wireless-Charger" class="headerlink" title="Qdos SnapStand 3-1 Wireless Charger"></a>Qdos SnapStand 3-1 Wireless Charger</h2><h3 id="Best-3-1-MagSafe-wireless-charger-for-travel"><a href="#Best-3-1-MagSafe-wireless-charger-for-travel" class="headerlink" title="Best 3-1 MagSafe wireless charger for travel"></a>Best 3-1 MagSafe wireless charger for travel</h3><p>There’s lots of functional (yet funky) wireless chargers on this list, but the Qdos SnapStand 3-1 wireless charger is by far the funkiest. This MagSafe charger offers 15W fast charging, and can charge your AirPods, Apple Watch, and iPhone simultaneously. The unique stacked ring design easily folds down flat for quick (and space-saving) transportation, and allows your iPhone to chill in standby mode when turned 90 degrees. </p><p>Although there are other 3-1 options on this list, only a few are foldable, and only this Qdos charger folds like this. Much like the Courant charger’s unique material and design, the Qdos brings its own standout aesthetic to the table (literally). While expanded to allow for 3-1 charging, this wireless charger resembles something along the sorts of an industrial stand and, while compact, something along the lines of a compressed stage. It’s so compact, that it fits in the back of my jean pocket (though it does protrude outwards). It’s just as easy to toss in a bag for traveling as the Anker 3-1; it just offers a much different approach to the same desired functionality. </p><p>When I tested the Qdos stand, I liked the 3-1 charging capabilities and the 15W iPhone charging, as well as how portable this design is. I have to give some extra kudos for the design, which is unlike anything else on this list (or on the market). My only downside to this charger is what it gains in design in lack of colorways, and it would’ve been really cool to see some more intentional colors to help elevate the overall aesthetic, as Courant did with their Catch 2. </p><p><strong>Qdos SnapStand 3-1 Wireless Charger features</strong>: <strong>Compatability</strong>: iPhone (any with MagSafe), Wireless Earbuds, Apple Watch | <strong>Color:</strong> Space Grey | Comes with wall adapter | Aesthetic design | Unique, fold-flat design | 60% recycled materials </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9041660-15735858?url=https%253A%252F%252Fnomadgoods.com%252Fproducts%252Fstand-one-max-carbide-3rd-gen&sid=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >View now at Nomad Goods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>3-1 charging</li><li>Qi2 charging</li><li>Stand design</li><li>Not travel-friendly</li><li>Metal and glass design</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>For iPhone only</li><li>Takes up more surface area</li><li>No wall adapter included</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098703/14409" target="_top" id="2098703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098703/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Nomad-Stand-One-Max"><a href="#Nomad-Stand-One-Max" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Stand One Max"></a>Nomad Stand One Max</h2><h3 id="Best-3-1-Wireless-Charging-Stand"><a href="#Best-3-1-Wireless-Charging-Stand" class="headerlink" title="Best 3-1 Wireless Charging Stand"></a>Best 3-1 Wireless Charging Stand</h3><p>If you’re looking for a true stand layout for your devices, Nomad’s Stand One Max is a ZDNET favorite. Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner prefers this Nomad stand (which is on its 3rd generation) over other options from Belkin, Anker, and more. Nomad brings elevated design and an environmentally conscious mindset to their tech gear. This 3-1 stand features 15W Qi2 charging and a fast Apple Watch charger. </p><p>It’s made of weighted metal and glass for a seamless design and is available in two basic colors: white and black. Its handy stand allows your iPhone to rest in StandBy mode, too. Although this Nomad stand features fast charging and three-device charging, its base is still a little larger than other stand configurations on the market due to the side-by-side placement of the iPhone and Apple Watch chargers, but it isn’t a downside if you don’t mind. If you are looking for more vertical stand configurations, you’re going to want to keep your eye out for options that stack their charging components, like the Qdos SnapStand, as opposed to one that places them next to each other. </p><p>Nomad customers love the overall appearance and charging capabilities this wireless charger offers, and it carries a 4&#x2F;5 star rating on their website. However, some customers reported a loose connection between the charging base and the included USB-C cord. </p><p><strong>Nomad Stand One Max Wireless Charger features</strong>: <strong>Compatability</strong>: iPhone (any with MagSafe), Wireless Earbuds, Apple Watch | <strong>Color:</strong> Carbide or Silver | Supports StandBy mode | Apple Watch Fast Charger | Luxury design | </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMH2JVMM?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cffa1c405-2403-430f-9a8b-796f5c5fdf11%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Compact</li><li>Qi2 charging</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>No wall adapter included</li><li>Single device charging</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087253/19272" target="_top" id="2087253">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087253" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087253/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Anker-MagGo-Qi2-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger"><a href="#Anker-MagGo-Qi2-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger" class="headerlink" title="Anker MagGo Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Charger"></a>Anker MagGo Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Charger</h2><h3 id="Best-singular-MagSafe-wireless-charger"><a href="#Best-singular-MagSafe-wireless-charger" class="headerlink" title="Best singular MagSafe wireless charger"></a>Best singular MagSafe wireless charger</h3><p>Sometimes you just need a single charger. If you’re looking for an affordable, easy-to-use, and travel-friendly charger, this MagSafe option from Anker is a great pick. It comes with a 5ft cord which makes it perfect for a bedside or couch side cord, and leverages Qi2 charging for a fast power boost. Charger your iPhone or wirelss earbuds like AirPods (one at a time, of course), without breaking the bank. This MagSafe charger is under $30 and is uber portable, too, but it does not include a wall adapter. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-20-magsafe-charger-is-better-and-cheaper-than-apples-own-accessory/"><strong>This $20 MagSafe charger is better and cheaper than Apple’s own accessory</strong></a></p><p>ZDNET’s Adrian Kingsley-Hughes tested this Anker MagSafe charger and was impressed with it’s charging rate, compact form, and design enough to purchase a second one for his off-grid setup. He liked it even more than another Anker charger he had been using, too. </p><p>“For $20 you get a modern, high-speed Qi2-certified charger that is as good as anything made by Apple. I’ve seen a lot of poorer-quality chargers on sale for $20 (and more!), so it’s refreshing to have a quality option at a budget price,” Kingsley-Hughes says. </p><p>Verified Amazon customers said they liked the functionality and strong magnetic connection of this charger. Several said that they liked the overall value of this Anker charger as well as the generous cord length and simple design. However, some customers said that the charger gets hot (although keep in mind it is normal for chargers to get slightly warm). </p><p><strong>Anker MagGo Qi2 Wireless Charger features</strong>: <strong>Compatability</strong>: iPhone (any with MagSafe), Wireless earbuds | 5ft cord | Lightweight and compact design | Budget-friendly </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-wireless-charger"><a href="#What-is-the-best-wireless-charger" class="headerlink" title="What is the best wireless charger?"></a>What is the best wireless charger?</h2><p>Our current top pick for the best wireless charger is Anker’s MagGo 3-1 Wireless Charging station.

If you’re in the market for a quick charger for travel or just because you’ll want to lean more towards Qi2 options.</li><li><strong>Design:</strong> Consider whether you plan to take your wireless charger on the go. If so, a portable, lightweight design may be a better fit for you. Likewise, if this charger will remain on your bedside table or desk, consider how much space you’re willing to give up, if you want a vertical or horizontal orientation (ie: stands vs. bases), and how many devices you’re wanting to charge at the same time.</li><li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Most of these wireless chargers use MagSafe technology, though several options do not. Some chargers also feature added USB-C or USB-A ports to allow for the charging of extra devices. Most importantly, be sure to check what types of charging your phone and other devices support before making a purchase. A MagSafe option won’t do you any good if your phone does support it (though remember, you can always <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-add-magsafe-to-your-android-phone-and-why-youll-love-it/" >convert your device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> into a MagSafe option).</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> Wireless chargers can vary in price depending on the type of charger you choose. For example, wireless chargers that accommodate multiple devices will likely be more expensive than single-device chargers. Wireless chargers range in price greatly, but most of the picks on this list are around $100 or more, depending on the model you choose. Also consider that wireless chargers are often one-time purchases, at least for a few years, so while they are pricier than cord combinations, it isn’t an everyday purchase.</li></ul><h2 id="What-is-MagSafe"><a href="#What-is-MagSafe" class="headerlink" title="What is MagSafe?"></a>What is MagSafe?</h2><p>MagSafe simply refers to a magnetic wireless charging technology developed by Apple. It uses a ring of strong magnets on the back of compatible devices (the iPhone 12 and newer, with some exceptions) to connect to your phone and charge wirelessly. MagSafe also allows you to attach other accessories, like wallets, stands, grips, and more to your phone securely. The point of the magnetic ring is to ensure a perfect alignment for efficient, effective charging and a strong grip. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037356/7443" target="_top" id="2037356">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037356" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037356/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-MagSafe-charging-better-than-cable-charging"><a href="#Is-MagSafe-charging-better-than-cable-charging" class="headerlink" title="Is MagSafe charging better than cable charging?"></a>Is MagSafe charging better than cable charging?</h2><p>It’s really up to you. </p><p>Both cable charging and wireless charging boost your phone effectively. But with a cable, you have to make sure you’re near an outlet or alternative power source when it comes time to recharge your phone. </p><p>With MagSafe, you can experience wire-free charging at home and even purchase a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-external-battery-pack-magnetic-15-watt/" >battery pack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for power on the go. So if you’re a mobile a lot, we recommend a MagSafe battery pack to keep your iPhone charged while you travel. For certain situations or environments, a cable may be preferred. For example, I test MagSafe battery packs when I commute into the office and on the go, and test MagSafe charging stations like those included with this list at home. But I also use a classic Lightning cable and wall adapter combo to charge my phone while I actively use my phone. When I charge my phone, AirPods, and Apple Watch overnight, I use Anker’s MagGo 3-1 setup. </p><h2 id="Do-wireless-chargers-work-on-all-phones"><a href="#Do-wireless-chargers-work-on-all-phones" class="headerlink" title="Do wireless chargers work on all phones?"></a>Do wireless chargers work on all phones?</h2><p>Yes and no. Most recent phone models within the last few years (including both Apple and Android) offer wireless charging. Most current iPhones, however, also feature MagSafe charging capabilities. It’s possible that you may still own a phone that doesn’t feature wireless charging, and that’s why It’s always a good idea to check the specs of your device to ensure wireless charging is an option. Always be sure to pay attention to your make and model while shopping for any type of charger, both wired and wireless. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983575">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983575.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983575">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983575.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983575%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983575/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="I-have-an-Android-Can-I-use-MagSafe"><a href="#I-have-an-Android-Can-I-use-MagSafe" class="headerlink" title="I have an Android.

In my testing experience, wireless chargers do not often come with a wall adapter in the box. If you have an extra on hand, this won’t be an issue, but it will be an added expense for most people, especially if the particular setup requires a larger wattage adapter. Keep this in mind while you shop. However, a few picks on this list truly come with the entire wireless charging setup, including the wall adapter, like the Courant Catch 2. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948881/19272" target="_top" id="1948881">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948881" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948881/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-there-alternative-wireless-chargers-worth-considering"><a href="#Are-there-alternative-wireless-chargers-worth-considering" class="headerlink" title="Are there alternative wireless chargers worth considering?"></a>Are there alternative wireless chargers worth considering?</h2><p>The mobile accessory market is full of wireless charging options both for Apple and Android devices. While some only offer dual charging capabilities, others can charge a smartwatch, smartphone, and wireless earbuds at the same time. You can also find wireless chargers at several price points and with more or less aesthetic appeal. Just keep in mind that the most important thing is using a charger that’s certified and from a reputable brand. Using cheap chargers may sometimes lead to long-term harm on your device. Here’s a few more wireless chargers to consider, all of which are ZDNET-tested. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://belkin.evyy.net/c/159047/214281/3736?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.belkin.com/p/3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-official-magsafe-charging-15w/WIZ017ttBK.html&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://belkin.evyy.net/c/159047/214281/3736?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.belkin.com/p/3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-official-magsafe-charging-15w/WIZ017ttBK.html&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://belkin.evyy.net/c/159047/214281/3736?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.belkin.com/p/3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-official-magsafe-charging-15w/WIZ017ttBK.html&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://belkin.evyy.net/c/159047/214281/3736?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.belkin.com/p/3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-official-magsafe-charging-15w/WIZ017ttBK.html&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://belkin.evyy.net/c/159047/214281/3736?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.belkin.com/p/3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-official-magsafe-charging-15w/WIZ017ttBK.html&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Another wireless charging stand alternative Belkin BoostCharge Pro Wireless 3-1 Charging 15W Stand <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://belkin.evyy.net/c/159047/214281/3736?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.belkin.com/p/3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-official-magsafe-charging-15w/WIZ017ttBK.html&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://belkin.evyy.net/c/159047/214281/3736?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.belkin.com/p/3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-official-magsafe-charging-15w/WIZ017ttBK.html&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro Wireless 3-1 Charging Stand was recently upgraded to include faster 15W charging.

I think it’s the perfect size for a desk, bedside table, or communal area, and isn’t too cumbersome-looking. My only negative is that it doesn’t come with a wall adapter, just a USB-C cord.

However, now that March has come and gone, it appears the release date will be pushed back – again – to early May 2024.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad-for-college/"><strong>The best iPads for college students: Expert tested</strong></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-28/when-is-the-new-ipad-pro-ipad-air-coming-out-apple-plans-early-may-launch" >Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Apple’s new line of iPad Pro‌ and ‌iPad Air‌ models – with the new M3 chips – will launch the first or second week of May. Patient observers of the iPad lineup will note that the previous updates occurred back in October 2022; those models featured the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ipad-pro-comes-with-the-m2-chip/" >M2 chip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, ProRes video capture, and the Apple Pencil hover experience. </p><p>The upcoming iPad Air will be available in the standard 11-inch display and a new, larger 12.9-inch, while the Pro line will be upgraded to OLED displays. These OLED displays should bring a significantly brighter, sharper screen to the iPad while demanding less power. Other new features expected to run with iPadOS 17.4 include upgraded Apple Pencil functionality and a new Magic Keyboard.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>So what’s behind the delay? It’s not entirely certain, but Gurman noted that “complex new manufacturing techniques” seem to have contributed to the push-back in release. The new OLED displays may have been the culprit, as these can be challenging to create at scale, especially in the new thinner designs on both the Pro and Air. Keep in mind that these will be the largest, thinnest iPads yet. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad-stylus/"><strong>The best iPad stylus you can buy: Expert tested</strong></a></p><p>Gurman also reported that overseas production of the new tablets was confirmed to be ramping up, which strongly suggests a launch date in the previously mentioned window. </p><h4 id="Featured-reviews"><a href="#Featured-reviews" class="headerlink" title="Featured reviews"></a>Featured reviews</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-best-smart-thermostats-ive-tested-is-not-made-by-ecobee-or-amazon/"  title="One of the best smart thermostats I&#39;ve tested is not made by Ecobee or Amazon">One of the best smart thermostats I’ve tested is not made by Ecobee or Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-im-recommending-the-standard-iphone-16-over-the-pro-this-year-and-im-not-alone/"  title="I demoed Apple&#39;s standard iPhone 16 and didn&#39;t envy the Pro models at all">I demoed Apple’s standard iPhone 16 and didn’t envy the Pro models at all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-lenovos-windows-laptop-that-doubles-as-an-android-tablet-and-it-has-so-much-potential/"  title="This Lenovo laptop that transforms into an Android tablet is the most clever device I&#39;ve tested">This Lenovo laptop that transforms into an Android tablet is the most clever device I’ve tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-apple-watch-series-10-the-oura-ring-is-my-go-to-health-tracker-for-one-obvious-reason/"  title="Forget Apple Watch Series 10: The Oura Ring is my go-to health tracker for one obvious reason">Forget Apple Watch Series 10: The Oura Ring is my go-to health tracker for one obvious reason <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-best-smart-thermostats-ive-tested-is-not-made-by-ecobee-or-amazon/"  title="One of the best smart thermostats I&#39;ve tested is not made by Ecobee or Amazon">One of the best smart thermostats I’ve tested is not made by Ecobee or Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-im-recommending-the-standard-iphone-16-over-the-pro-this-year-and-im-not-alone/"  title="I demoed Apple&#39;s standard iPhone 16 and didn&#39;t envy the Pro models at all">I demoed Apple’s standard iPhone 16 and didn’t envy the Pro models at all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-lenovos-windows-laptop-that-doubles-as-an-android-tablet-and-it-has-so-much-potential/"  title="This Lenovo laptop that transforms into an Android tablet is the most clever device I&#39;ve tested">This Lenovo laptop that transforms into an Android tablet is the most clever device I’ve tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-apple-watch-series-10-the-oura-ring-is-my-go-to-health-tracker-for-one-obvious-reason/"  title="Forget Apple Watch Series 10: The Oura Ring is my go-to health tracker for one obvious reason">Forget Apple Watch Series 10: The Oura Ring is my go-to health tracker for one obvious reason <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-embracing-the-commons-digital-access-to-classics-for-2024/"><u>[New] Embracing the Commons Digital Access to Classics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-pristine-screenshot-tool-free-and-simple/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Pristine Screenshot Tool -

Should I buy an older model for less money? Is the “Pro” model worth it? And should I spring for the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-we-expect-at-apples-iphone-16-event-ai-features-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-more/" >iPhone 16 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? That’s because the iPhone lineup is more convoluted than ever, with Apple now offering a total of 13 models, not counting the refurbished ones, on its website and in stores, with the arrival of the new <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-is-the-iphone-16-coming-out-what-to-know-and-where-to-preorder/" >iPhone 16 line <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/"><strong>The best phones: Expert tested</strong></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-the-best-iPhone-right-now"><a href="#What-is-the-best-iPhone-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What is the best iPhone right now?"></a>What is the best iPhone right now?</h2><p>ZDNET’s mobile experts <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-phones/" >carefully test <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> every iPhone model at release, putting them through their paces to provide you with the best advice on which model to buy and the key features to look out for when you do.

While it launched in September of last year, the 6.7-inch model is still the largest iPhone Apple currently offers. It has the latest features, including support for future <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >Apple Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> tools in iOS 18. </p><p>The iPhone 15 Pro Max looks and feels different than prior Pro Max models, as it’s made of titanium instead of stainless steel. This material choice “makes the Pro phones about 10% lighter (than their predecessors) and is very durable,” ZDNET’s editor-in-chief, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/jason-hiner/" >Jason Hiner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, noted when first reviewing the phone.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-review/"><strong>iPhone 15 Pro: Coming from iPhone 12 Pro or earlier? This upgrade will wow you</strong></a></p><p>Another major feature of the iPhone 15 Pro Max is the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-usb-c-cables-for-the-iphone-15/" >USB-C connector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. While that may sound underwhelming, the switch from Lightning means the iPhone now supports faster charging and data transfers, the ability to charge AirPods and other USB-C accessories, and the ability to connect to an external 4K monitor. Some users on Reddit even suggest that the switch to USB-C was what brought them back to the iPhone.</p><p>The iPhone 15 Pro Max also features a new 5x zoom camera lens – the equivalent of a 120mm focal length on a mirrorless or DSLR camera – a new Action button that lets you better customize shortcuts and easily open the apps you need, and an A17 Pro chip that’s snappier and more capable of handling machine-learning, on-background tasks than other iPhone models.</p><p><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max specs:</strong> <strong>Processor:</strong> Apple A17 Pro Bionic | <strong>Display size:</strong> 6.7 inches with 120Hz refresh rate | <strong>Storage options:</strong> 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | <strong>Rear cameras:</strong> 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, and 12MP 5x telephoto | <strong>Front camera:</strong> 12MP | <strong>Colors:</strong> Natural Titanium, Blue, White, Black | <strong>Weight:</strong> 221g | <strong>Starting price:</strong> $1,099 </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-15-128gb-black-verizon/6418070.p?skuId=6418070&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>USB-C charging</li><li>Dynamic Island multitasking support</li><li>Matte back</li><li>Sleek design with curved edges</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Pricer than most flagship smartphones</li><li>No battery life improvement over prior model</li></ul><h2 id="Apple-iPhone-15"><a href="#Apple-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="Apple iPhone 15"></a>Apple iPhone 15</h2><h3 id="Best-iPhone-for-most-people"><a href="#Best-iPhone-for-most-people" class="headerlink" title="Best iPhone for most people"></a>Best iPhone for most people</h3><p>The iPhone 15 looks great, feels great, and performs how a premium phone should. It also starts at $300 less than the iPhone 15 Pro series, putting it in closer reach for most consumers. With this model, Apple has also given it USB-C charging, though the phone tops up at a slower pace (18W instead of 30W), the Dynamic Island for multitasking, and a matte back design that’s less prone to fingerprint marks – putting it closer to the Pro version than ever. </p><p>The iPhone 15 offers a thinner, slightly lighter form factor than its predecessor, the iPhone 14, whether you opt for the standard size or Plus. When I reviewed the model at launch, I was very impressed by how the curved edges gave me a confident grip without digging deeply into my palm. That’s been a pain point with older iPhone models, which flaunted sharper, glossier designs.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/"><strong>iPhone 15: Why I recommend this model even to ‘Pro’ users in 2024</strong></a></p><p>Apple also gave the latest iPhone a promising camera upgrade, with a new 48MP main sensor that lets you crop into photos and retain more detail and color accuracy than ever. As pulled from my review, “the iPhone’s color science leans more natural, prioritizing the finer details like subjects underneath shadows and how evenly lit everything in the frame is.”</p><p>Pair the reliable camera with great battery life, a reliable A16 Bionic chip, and a swatch of charming colors, and you have an iPhone that most people can buy and enjoy. Best Buy customers seem to agree with that sentiment, commending the iPhone 15’s camera quality, endurance, and overall performance.</p><p><strong>iPhone 15 specs: Processor:</strong> Apple A16 Bionic | <strong>Display size:</strong> 6.1 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | <strong>Storage options:</strong> 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | <strong>Rear cameras:</strong> 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide | <strong>Front camera:</strong> 12MP | <strong>Colors:</strong> Pink, Yellow, Blue, Green, Black | <strong>Weight:</strong> 171g | <strong>Starting price:</strong> $799 </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-13-Mini-Midnight/dp/B09LKTXKXQ?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cec07ee1a-6f74-4d85-9f86-88a8fe871922%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-iPhone-13-Mini-Unlocked-128GB-Midnight/1559819323&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-pre-owned-iphone-13-mini-5g-256gb-unlocked-midnight/6567171.p?skuId=6567171&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Last iPhone Mini model you can buy</li><li>Identical internals to the iPhone 13</li><li>Size doesn’t compromise on performance and camera quality</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>No high refresh rate display</li><li>Subpar battery life</li><li>Shorter software update schedule</li><li>Need to buy refurbished</li></ul><h2 id="Apple-iPhone-13-Mini"><a href="#Apple-iPhone-13-Mini" class="headerlink" title="Apple iPhone 13 Mini"></a>Apple iPhone 13 Mini</h2><h3 id="Best-small-iPhone"><a href="#Best-small-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Best small iPhone"></a>Best small iPhone</h3><p>While Apple has officially <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-iphone-mini-is-dead-long-live-the-iphone-plus/" >discontinued its iPhone Mini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> models, Avi Greengart, lead analyst at Techsponential, suggests the iPhone 13 Mini for anyone eyeing a small flagship iPhone. He’s not wrong: The iPhone 13 Mini is the only compact option in the US that includes specs similar to that of its larger siblings.

If you find yourself taking advantage of the dual 12MP rear cameras, the base storage of 128GB (upgradeable up to 512GB) should be sufficient for creative needs.</p><p>The iPhone SE (2022) is the other contender for small iPhones, but its outdated design makes the iPhone 13 Mini the more practical choice in the modern age of digital consumption. Speaking of which, there are some obvious drawbacks to the smaller form factor, like battery life, display quality, and multitasking. But if you can shoulder the three, like several satisfied Reddit users, the iPhone 13 Mini is definitively the best mini iPhone available right now.</p><p><strong>iPhone 13 Mini specs: Processor:</strong> Apple A15 | <strong>Display size:</strong> 5.4 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | <strong>Storage options:</strong> 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | <strong>Rear cameras:</strong> Two 12MP (wide and ultra-wide) | <strong>Front camera:</strong> 12MP | <strong>Colors:</strong> Starlight, Midnight, Red, Pink, Blue | <strong>Weight:</strong> 141g | <strong>Starting Price:</strong> $350</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-se&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9041660-15763068-1709658971000?sid=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at AT&amp;T <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-pre-owned-iphone-se-2020-64gb-unlocked-black/6519727.p?skuId=6519727&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>It’s an iPhone… for $429</li><li>Solid battery life</li><li>Excellent software support</li><li>Smallest form factor of any iPhone</li><li>IP67 dust&#x2F;water resistant</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Outdated design</li><li>Display may come off as cramped for some</li><li>Not the most flexible camera system</li></ul><h2 id="Apple-iPhone-SE-2022"><a href="#Apple-iPhone-SE-2022" class="headerlink" title="Apple iPhone SE (2022)"></a>Apple iPhone SE (2022)</h2><h3 id="Best-cheap-iPhone"><a href="#Best-cheap-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Best cheap iPhone"></a>Best cheap iPhone</h3><p>Going off of retail price alone, the 2022 iPhone SE is the cheapest iPhone on the market right now.

If you were a fan of the pre-notch era of iPhones, the iPhone SE will scratch that old-time itch.</p><p>The A15 processor, compared to its predecessor’s A13, brings improved performance, longer battery life, and enhanced photography results, as tested ‘s former contributor <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/jason-cipriani/" >Jason Cipriani <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. “The lone 12-megapixel camera is no slouch.

Part of the reason is how similar its design is to the Pro variant, especially regarding form factor, button placement, and even the charging tech. </p><p>But the more obvious reason is the price. The permanent price reduction makes the iPhone 14 the “best old-generation iPhone” for now. Originally selling for $799, the 2022 iPhone can now be had for $699 at your local Apple store.</p><p><strong>Review: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-review/" >Apple iPhone 14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For folks who are not as invested in the latest camera features and hardware, which is most people, the price difference is enough to justify buying the regular iPhone 14 instead of one of the Pro models or even the latest iPhone 15. That doesn’t mean you’re settling for an inferior iPhone experience. With its A15 Bionic chip, the iPhone 14 should power you through general tasks like social media browsing, emailing, video calls, gaming, and then some. </p><p>The iPhone 14’s dual camera system at the rear has been carried over from the iPhone 13 Pro, which, if you read <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-iphone-13-pro-max/" >our full review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, should give you confidence more than anything else. If you do buy the iPhone 14 (or any older phone model), it’s always helpful to replace the battery so that you have a full-health cell to work with, making the phone feel like new again.</p><p><strong>iPhone 14 specs: Processor:</strong> Apple A15 | <strong>Display size:</strong> 6.1 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | <strong>Storage options:</strong> 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | <strong>Rear cameras:</strong> Dual 12MP (Wide, ultra-wide) | <strong>Front camera:</strong> 12MP | <strong>Colors:</strong> Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, Red | <strong>Weight:</strong> 172g | <strong>Starting price:</strong> $699 </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-iPhone"><a href="#What-is-the-best-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="What is the best iPhone?"></a>What is the best iPhone?</h2><p>After weighing out the specs and reviewer-tested experiences, the best iPhone is currently the iPhone 15 Pro Max. It’s got a beautiful AMOLED display, a powerful (and future-proofed) chipset, and a reliable camera system that covers all the bases and angles. Naturally, the 15 Pro Max is also Apple’s most expensive model, so if pricing is a concern, consider cheaper options like the standard 15 Pro and even older models. </p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>iPhone models compared</strong></th><th><strong>Base Price</strong></th><th><strong>Base Storage</strong></th><th><strong>Display</strong></th><th><strong>Processor</strong></th><th><strong>Cameras</strong> <strong>(rear)</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>iPhone 15 Pro Max</td><td>$1,099</td><td>128GB</td><td>6.7 inches</td><td>A17</td><td>Three</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 15</td><td>$799</td><td>128GB</td><td>6.1 inches</td><td>A16</td><td>Two</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 14</td><td>$699</td><td>128GB</td><td>6.1 inches</td><td>A15</td><td>Two</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 13 Mini</td><td>$480</td><td>128GB</td><td>5.4 inches</td><td>A15</td><td>Two</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone SE (3rd Generation)</td><td>$429</td><td>64GB</td><td>4.7 inches</td><td>A15</td><td>One</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105866/7443" target="_top" id="2105866">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105866" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105866/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-iPhones-the-best-smartphone"><a href="#Are-iPhones-the-best-smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Are iPhones the best smartphone?"></a>Are iPhones the best smartphone?</h2><p>The answer depends on your needs and preferences.

This is especially true of the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro, which feature nearly the same hardware, so check out our question above for more on this decision. </p><p>Size is generally the first factor to consider, followed by price. Price limits will also drive the amount of internal storage you select for your iPhone. </p><p>One fantastic aspect of the iPhone is that all models receive software support for years and years, so it’s perfectly viable to buy an older model and trust that it will work well for you for quite some time.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Choose this iPhone…</strong></th><th><strong>If you want…</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</td><td>The top-of-the-line iPhone experience.

Here’s the breakdown of what factors we look for.</p><ul><li><strong>Display</strong>: Possibly the most overlooked feature on a smartphone, the display is what you stare at, scroll at, and interact with day in and day out. Therefore, when picking the best iPhones – no matter the budget - puts an emphasis on devices with above-average panels. Ideally, a good display covers a wide color gamut, is durable, and has a high refresh rate for the smoothest visuals.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong>: One of iPhones’ biggest strengths is their in-house silicon, namely the A-series of Apple chipsets. Thanks to this mingling of proprietary hardware and software, we’ve found the latest iPhones very capable of running the daily and weekly onslaught of apps and services.</li><li><strong>Camera quality</strong>: From group selfies to slow-motion videos, the best iPhones feature camera systems that are reliable and flexible to capture any shot you want. Naturally, an ample amount of storage size is also considered during the selection process.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>: For how reliant we’ve become on smartphones, the top picks on this list are not only able to last you from morning to night but also support fast charging when it’s time to top up.</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: What you won’t find on this list is a device that’s not worth the money or is overcharging you for the hardware-software package you’re getting.</li></ul><h2 id="How-we-test-iPhones"><a href="#How-we-test-iPhones" class="headerlink" title="How we test iPhones"></a>How we test iPhones</h2><p>ZDNET’s review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major iPhone release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and more. Here’s a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:</p><ul><li><strong>Design and ergonomics:</strong> How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users’ buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> Several factors affect a phone’s performance, including LTE&#x2F;5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.</li><li><strong>Camera quality:</strong> ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.</li><li><strong>Battery life and charging:</strong> It’s also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both).</li><li><strong>Special features:</strong> These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.</li><li><strong>Pricing and availability:</strong> Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.</li></ul><p>For a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-phones/" >phone testing methodology page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="iPhone-FAQs"><a href="#iPhone-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="iPhone FAQs"></a>iPhone FAQs</h2><h3 id="How-do-I-take-care-of-my-new-iPhone"><a href="#How-do-I-take-care-of-my-new-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="How do I take care of my new iPhone?"></a>How do I take care of my new iPhone?</h3><p>There are several ways you can keep your iPhone clean and pristine. </p><ol><li>One way is by equipping a protective case and&#x2F;or screen protector. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone-15-case/" >best iPhone cases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offer reliable drop and scratch protection, won’t bulk up the phone, and may feature some extra utility like a kickstand or MagSafe ring. As for screen protectors, tempered glass options are your best bet to keep the display underneath free of scratches and cracks. They’re relatively affordable, too, often coming in <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Ailun-Protector-Installation-Friendly-Tempered/dp/B0CCYN42DL/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cec07ee1a-6f74-4d85-9f86-88a8fe871922%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >multi-packs for less than $10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Battery management is another key aspect of iPhone maintenance. To keep your device running for as long as possible, consider charging it between 20% to 80% battery. Overcharging the device would otherwise wear down the battery and reduce the health value (found in Settings). When your iPhone battery health is low (anything less than 75% typically is), it would be helpful to get it replaced at an Apple store or by an Apple-authorized technician.</li><li>As stressful as it may be to clear up space to download that software update, you absolutely should. Besides fixing any bugs on your iPhone, software updates also bring with them security patches to reduce the chances of your phone getting hacked.</li></ol><h3 id="When-is-iOS-18-coming-and-will-my-iPhone-support-it"><a href="#When-is-iOS-18-coming-and-will-my-iPhone-support-it" class="headerlink" title="When is iOS 18 coming, and will my iPhone support it?"></a>When is iOS 18 coming, and will my iPhone support it?</h3><p>The upcoming software version for the iPhone is currently in its <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/you-can-download-ios-18-beta-on-your-iphone-right-now-heres-how-and-which-models-support-it/" >public beta phase <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning it’s open for any users to test.

The only exception here is the iPhone SE model. While not as flashy of an upgrade as larger camera sensors and 120Hz displays, this double-up of storage meant that consumers had more space than ever to store apps, photos, videos, and more.</p><p>Maurice Klaehne, senior market research analyst at Counterpoint Research, suggests that higher storage options are generally better as they will help with the longevity of the device, and his firm has generally seen an uptick in postpaid customers opting for higher storage sizes when they can afford them. “Currently, the 256GB option is sufficient for most people,” Klaehne adds.</p><h3 id="Should-I-trade-in-my-old-iPhone"><a href="#Should-I-trade-in-my-old-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Should I trade in my old iPhone?"></a>Should I trade in my old iPhone?</h3><p>Trading in an old iPhone is one of the easiest (and safest) ways to replace an otherwise unwanted device with a new, more capable one. Most retailers, including Apple, accept trade-ins of older iPhone models, with store credit ranging from as low as $50 to $800; it all depends on which generation your iPhone is, the condition, and whether it turns on or not.</p><h3 id="Do-I-really-need-an-iPhone-case"><a href="#Do-I-really-need-an-iPhone-case" class="headerlink" title="Do I really need an iPhone case?"></a>Do I really need an iPhone case?</h3><p>While an iPhone case is not a necessity – your iPhone will still function normally without it – having one on greatly reduces the chances of wear and tear. For example, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone-15-case/" >best cases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are military-grade certified, meaning they’ll keep your iPhone protected from waist-high drops.

While it’s not as glass-heavy or flashy as the newer iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro models, the iPhone 13 remains a formidable choice due to its durability, long battery life, and SIM card support. This latter feature is particularly important if your parent travels overseas or prefers the simplicity of swapping a physical SIM card to transfer contacts and data.</p><p>The cameras on the iPhone 13 are reliable enough for clear video calls, the occasional outdoor photo, and capturing images of children and pets.</p><h3 id="What-is-eSIM"><a href="#What-is-eSIM" class="headerlink" title="What is eSIM?"></a>What is eSIM?</h3><p>Embedded Subscriber Identity Module, or eSIM in short, is the electronic version of the classic SIM card. That means your eSIM carries your phone number, mobile data plan, and telephone carrier info, just like a regular SIM card. The major difference between eSIM and SIM is that the former does not need to be physically installed onto your phone, which is why the iPhone 14 and 15 lines no longer have a dedicated slot for it. Instead, you’ll have to transfer the information wirelessly via Apple’s file transfer service, or with the help of your local carrier representatives. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/esim-vs-sim-whats-the-difference/" >eSIM vs. SIM: What’s the difference? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>There is one problem that ZDNET editor-in-chief <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/jason-hiner/" >Jason Hiner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> sees with Apple forcing eSIM adoption on US consumers. “There are a variety of good reasons why some people will still need or prefer a phone with a physical SIM card. The top reason is privacy. This is especially true for some journalists and populations at risk of persecution around the world. Removing the physical SIM card option reduces privacy for millions of people, especially some of the most vulnerable,” said Hiner. </p><p>Note that if you buy an iPhone 14 or 15 anywhere outside of the US, the device will come with a regular SIM card slot. </p><h3 id="Which-iPhone-models-support-5G"><a href="#Which-iPhone-models-support-5G" class="headerlink" title="Which iPhone models support 5G?"></a>Which iPhone models support 5G?</h3><p>All models within the iPhone 15, 14, and 13 line, as well as select iPhone 12 models, support <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-5g-the-business-guide-to-next-generation-wireless-technology/" >5G wireless technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Even the new iPhone SE (2022) supports Sub-6, low-band 5G networks.</p><p>5G continues to roll out across the US, and while it is debatable if there are benefits to the speeds of the network, in my experience, the broad coverage of low-band 5G has solved my connectivity issues in spotty coverage areas with past iPhone models.</p><p>Even more importantly, the 5G iPhone models have Qualcomm chipsets inside that are proving to provide better RF reception than we saw in past iPhones that had Intel chipsets. </p><h3 id="Which-iPhone-models-support-wireless-charging-or-MagSafe"><a href="#Which-iPhone-models-support-wireless-charging-or-MagSafe" class="headerlink" title="Which iPhone models support wireless charging or MagSafe?"></a>Which iPhone models support wireless charging or MagSafe?</h3><p>All of the iPhone models in this list support Qi wireless charging technology. Wireless charging is becoming an expected feature for modern smartphones from all manufacturers.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple’s proprietary MagSafe technology is only supported by the iPhone 15, iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone 12 models. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-accessory/" >Best MagSafe accessories for your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>MagSafe provides a secure magnetic connection system so that you can connect to wireless chargers with perfect positioning and alignment. MagSafe can also be used with other accessories, such as wallets and kickstands. </p><p>While the extra security when your iPhone is docked to a wireless charger can be a nice bonus, it’s not vital and probably shouldn’t be a major determiner in your choice. Apple’s first-party wallets and battery packs that use MagSafe have also received somewhat mixed reviews, making them a hard sell for all except the most die-hard Apple enthusiasts. </p><h3 id="How-many-years-do-iPhones-typically-last"><a href="#How-many-years-do-iPhones-typically-last" class="headerlink" title="How many years do iPhones typically last?"></a>How many years do iPhones typically last?</h3><p>While this number varies greatly depending on how you handle a smartphone – perhaps you’re a construction worker whose phone will be put through the harshest climates or you have kids who may drop the phone ever so often – the iPhone will typically run efficiently for three to four years. </p><p>Then, you’ll likely experience more frequent app crashes, lag, storage problems, and more. Those are common issues that any piece of technology will inhibit, not just the iPhone, after years of constant usage. </p><p>If you’d like to prolong that time, I’d recommend visiting your local Apple store to have the phone’s battery replaced every three to four years and also consider backing up files to an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-external-hard-drive/" >external hard drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for safekeeping.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Apple’s-Visionary-Leap-Introducing-a-Domestic-Robotic-Companion-Explores"><a href="#Apple’s-Visionary-Leap-Introducing-a-Domestic-Robotic-Companion-Explores" class="headerlink" title="Apple’s Visionary Leap: Introducing a Domestic Robotic Companion  Explores"></a>Apple’s Visionary Leap: Introducing a Domestic Robotic Companion  Explores</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/a4ebaa4d0dcc4a258336cfd2688079f06693e3f2/2024/08/26/006c3acb-66ea-4860-85a4-677cad379348/gettyimages-1284744055.jpg?auto=webp&precrop=2120,1191,x0,y107&width=1280"                      alt="gettyimages-1284744055"                ></p><p>Westend61&#x2F;Getty Images</p><p>We’ve long been fascinated with the idea of having robots around the house to take care of daily chores, freeing us up for more interesting pursuits. Though it would be cool to think that a robot like the Jetsons’ <a class="link"   href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0773919/" >Rosey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is just around the corner, we’re going to have to wait a bit longer for that future.</p><p>Even so, that vision has prompted Apple to investigate the world of robotics to see what would be possible in the short term. The company is currently in the early phases of figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-25/apple-plans-tabletop-robot-while-exploring-mobile-bots-and-humanoid-machines-m09kawex" >how best to use robotics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said in his latest Power On newsletter. If the efforts bear fruit, we could potentially see mobile robots and even humanoid models sometime in the next decade.</p><p>For now, Apple is eyeing a way to add robotics to other devices, an idea the company first cooked up around 2020, according to Gurman. Likely popping up around 2026 or 2027, the first test product in this vein will be a tabletop device with the codename J595. It will feature a large display similar to the iPad with cameras and a base that includes a robotic actuator arm.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/six-levels-of-autonomous-work-how-ai-augments-then-replaces/" >Six levels of autonomous work: How AI augments, then replaces <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>With this robotic arm attached, the device could swivel around to face you if you need to hop on a video call or check out a website for recipes while in the kitchen. This concept could even lead to more advanced machines capable of loading a washing machine or cleaning dirty dishes. </p><p>However, Gurman stressed that these concepts are so far into the future that, for now, they only exist as rough sketches on a whiteboard. </p><p>At this point, Apple’s overarching goal with robotics is to solve some of the limitations and challenges we face with today’s computers and mobile devices. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Gurman noted several examples of these limitations. For instance, you might want to use your computer or mobile phone, but it’s in another location at home or elsewhere. Maybe you want to take photos of a scene or kick off a video chat, but you’re not directly in front of your device. You may want to check or operate something at your home while you’re away. In each of these situations, robotic technology would allow you to control a device from afar.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-i-used-chatgpt-to-scan-170k-lines-of-code-in-seconds-and-save-me-hours-of-detective-work/" >How I used ChatGPT to scan 170k lines of code in seconds and save me hours of detective work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The road to robotics has gotten a push from the latest developments in <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/" >artificial intelligence (AI) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Any future robotic device would clearly rely on AI for its internal smarts. In a Power On newsletter from April, Gurman said that Apple has been <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-reportedly-exploring-ai-powered-home-robots-including-these-two-products/" >exploring the development <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of personal robots. Powered by embedded AI, such a product would act like a mobile assistant that follows you around the house. </p><p>Of course, even a robot needs a personality. Though Siri is the voice of the iPhone, iPad, and other Apple products, the company is developing a different technology for its robots. Gurman <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/#link={" >said <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the new interface, based on generative AI, would eventually run on the tabletop unit and other Apple robotic devices.</p><p>Beyond AI, Apple could also fine-tune robotic devices through its expertise in sensors, advanced silicon, engineering, and batteries, Gurman explained. Even further, the company might be able to help a robotic assistant navigate by applying its knowledge of how to map spaces around devices.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-talks-ai-rust-adoption-and-why-the-linux-kernel-is-the-only-thing-that-matters/" >Linus Torvalds talks AI, Rust adoption, and why the Linux kernel is ‘the only thing that matters’ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Still, success is far from guaranteed. Apple had been working on a self-driving car project for almost ten years. However, that project faced a number of obstacles, eventually forcing the company to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-just-killed-its-electric-car-project-shifting-focus-to-generative-ai/#link={" >shut it down <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> earlier this year. Apple doesn’t win at every attempt at a new product – no matter how many people and other resources are thrown at it.</p><p>Yes, you can already get robots that <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/robot-vacuum-deals/" >roam the house <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> today. But your average contemporary robot is a simple device, more of a novelty than an advanced mechanical person. As Gurman notes, home robots would have to surmount technical challenges in order to truly succeed – like learning how to navigate the average multi-level house, not just one level the way a smart vacuum can.</p><p>As with any new and advanced technology, the first robotic devices will cost Apple a lot to build (and customers a lot to buy). Though the company has already brought in top robotics experts, it will need more engineers and other talent to create products that will both work and sell. </p><p>Still, if Apple can succeed with robotics, the company will have found another way to potentially improve life for those of us who always wished we had our own personal Rosey.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-im-recommending-the-standard-iphone-16-over-the-pro-this-year-and-im-not-alone/"  title="Why I&#39;m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I&#39;m not alone)">Why I’m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-onedrive-messing-with-your-files-how-to-get-your-windows-storage-under-control/"  title="Is OneDrive messing with your files?

Sonos, a major player in the multi-room audio market, recently updated its <a class="link"   href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/controller-app" >S2 controller app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for iOS, iPadOS, and Android. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-sonos/" >The best Sonos speakers: How the Sonos One, Arc, Beam, and more compare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The latest version of Sonos offers a more uniform and simplified user interface. Furthermore, Sonos has introduced a web-based user experience for Mac and Windows desktop platforms. This web-based interface is accessible through <a class="link"   href="https://www.sonos.com/web-app" >www.sonos.com/web-app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and also functions on ChromeOS and other desktop versions of Linux which use Chrome and Chromium-based browsers. This new web-based interface will replace the old desktop controller, as the company has stopped distributing the desktop version.</p><p>While this move towards a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/sonos-app-overhaul-will-deliver-customizable-home-screen-universal-search-and-more/" >more integrated software environment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is exciting, it does raise questions about the future of hardware upgrades and the lifespan of existing devices.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Observations-of-the-new-S2-UX"><a href="#Observations-of-the-new-S2-UX" class="headerlink" title="Observations of the new S2 UX"></a>Observations of the new S2 UX</h2><p>The new Sonos S2 controller app for iPadOS.</p><p>Screenshot by Jason Perlow&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The new user experience (UX) of Sonos’s iOS, Android, and iPadOS apps is consistent and visually appealing. The design is modern and streamlined, focusing on accessibility (which the company admits is a <a class="link"   href="https://en.community.sonos.com/controllers-and-music-services-228995/new-sonos-app-and-accessibility-6892068" >work in progress <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) and readability. The web version, which has replaced the desktop version, also follows this approach, indicating a strategic alignment in Sonos’ software development. </p><p>Although I did not extensively explore the web UX, I tested its functionality for finding and playing music in different rooms. The web UX appears to be designed to reflect the settings of the smartphone UX and, as such, is strictly a content player. Configuring and changing the settings of a Sonos system or its components now requires the smartphone app, as none of these tasks can be completed through the browser.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>It is uncertain whether the codebase is entirely unified. The missing configuration options in the web user interface indicate that the smartphone versions may require extra local software components to execute that specific function.</p><p> What is evident is that for the web control to function, the Sonos device components now have significantly more cloud connectivity than they did before.</p><p>Nevertheless, the consistent visual appearance across all platforms significantly enhances the user experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975562">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975562">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975562%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975562/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-harmonious-advantages-of-Sonos’-web-based-platform"><a href="#The-harmonious-advantages-of-Sonos’-web-based-platform" class="headerlink" title="The harmonious: advantages of Sonos’ web-based platform"></a>The harmonious: advantages of Sonos’ web-based platform</h2><p>The new Sonos S2 web controller, as shown on a Mac.</p><p>Screenshot by Jason Perlow&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The primary advantage of Sonos’ new software strategy lies in its apparent commitment to uniformity. By developing a single, cohesive web-based platform, Sonos ensures that all users, regardless of the device they use, experience the same interface and features. This consistency eliminates the fragmentation often seen in apps developed separately for different platforms and aligns perfectly with the contemporary consumer’s expectation for seamless integration.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-most-premium-chromebooks-ive-tested-is-cheaper-than-youd-think/" >One of the most premium Chromebooks I’ve tested is cheaper than you’d think <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The updated software sports a cleaner design and boasts enhanced functionality, such as improved search capabilities, making it easier for users to find their favorite music and podcasts. This focus on usability can significantly enhance user satisfaction and cement Sonos’s reputation as a user-centric brand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948932/19272" target="_top" id="1948932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-dissonant-the-challenge-of-hardware-compatibility-and-loss-of-functionality"><a href="#The-dissonant-the-challenge-of-hardware-compatibility-and-loss-of-functionality" class="headerlink" title="The dissonant: the challenge of hardware compatibility and loss of functionality"></a>The dissonant: the challenge of hardware compatibility and loss of functionality</h2><p>Moving to a web-based platform might not be without its challenges. This approach indicates a potential shift from prioritizing hardware to prioritizing software, which might result in slower hardware innovation or force older models to become obsolete if they cannot support newer software updates. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/these-speakers-deliver-impressively-accurate-sound-for-any-style-of-music/" >These speakers deliver impressively accurate sound for any style of music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In the past, Sonos has faced criticism for transitioning between major software versions, such as the move from S1 to S2, which left some older devices unable to integrate with newer systems. This segmentation of the ecosystem can be frustrating for users who have invested heavily in their audio setups only to find them somewhat outdated due to software incompatibilities. </p><p>While the <a class="link"   href="https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/sonos-app-version-compatibility" >list of S2-compatible hardware has not changed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with the controller and recent firmware updates to support it, the changeover to this now cloud-connected version raises a few eyebrows. </p><p>The web version of the application performs well overall. However, depending on network conditions, it communicates with the Sonos components through a cloud connection, and those components may respond slowly to certain commands, such as adjusting the volume or forwarding to the next track on a playlist. </p><p>Additionally, we have experienced a few Internal Server Errors (ISEs) on the web client. When this occurs, we had to restart the browser session (in our case, Safari) running the application, which may indicate initial cloud capacity issues as Sonos rolled out the new web UX. These issues have been observed since the initial publication of this article.</p><p>The biggest source of anguish from Sonos customers is that the new S2 update also appears to have (temporarily) removed the ability to <a class="link"   href="https://en.community.sonos.com/controllers-and-music-services-229131/new-app-ios-and-local-music-library-nas-6892405" >search local music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (due to the removal of SMB1 and HTTPS library connectivity), as confirmed by support. <a class="link"   href="https://en.community.sonos.com/advanced-setups-229133/looks-like-we-may-lose-our-networked-libraries-with-next-big-update-nas-drive-6891981" >In a future update <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be re-established with SMB2 and cloud library support. There’s also a current inability to edit playlists and song queues in the new app, which is angering users.</p><p>The company is <a class="link"   href="https://en.community.sonos.com/events/sonos-app-redesign-ama-6" >hosting an AMA on May 14th <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to address customer concerns about these redesign issues.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948891/19272" target="_top" id="1948891">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948891" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948891/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-bigger-picture-software-over-hardware"><a href="#The-bigger-picture-software-over-hardware" class="headerlink" title="The bigger picture: software over hardware?"></a>The bigger picture: software over hardware?</h2><p>A view of the Sonos S2 controller on iPhone.</p><p>Screenshot by Jason Perlow&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The consumer electronics industry is shifting towards a software-dominated approach, where device functionality and durability depend more on software updates than hardware capabilities.

These games focus on teaching the alphabet, counting, memorizing, and other academic and practical abilities.</p><p> We’ve found that introducing our children to learning through play in various ways at a young age can help foster a lifelong love of learning; it also doesn’t hurt (sometimes) to keep them busy for a few minutes so we can get work done.  </p><p>01</p><p>of 09</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Sesame-Street-Games"><a href="#Sesame-Street-Games" class="headerlink" title="Sesame Street Games"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.sesamestreet.org/games" >Sesame Street Games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/HssMr28p0za0VT3mhkHJ7D4Y2s4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/sesamestreet-4306c7ddb243417a8f04387e966f6644.jpg"                      alt="The homepage of Sesame Street"                ></p><p>Sesame Street</p><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>Signing up for an account is free.</li><li>Sort games by which characters are in them.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>Must sign up for an account to access all content.</li></ul><p><em>Sesame Street</em> has got a ton of great free preschool games that feature your child’s favorite_Sesame Street_ characters.

It allows you to manage multiple email accounts from one location with advanced filtering features.</p><p> This article covers Mozilla Thunderbird 52.

Features include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Mail Account Setup Wizard</strong> : With the setup wizard, you don’t need to know your IMAP, SMTP, and SSL&#x2F;TLS settings. After you enter your name, email address, and password, the wizard checks Thunderbird and selects the correct settings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Attachment Reminder</strong> : When your outgoing email mentions “attachment” or a similar term, Thunderbird reminds you to add the attachment before you send the email.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multiple-Channel Chat</strong> : Use the Chat feature to reach contacts from Facebook Chat, Google Talk, IRC, X (formerly Twitter), or XMPP. Search past conversations and receive emails from your contacts.</p></li><li><p><strong>One-Click Address Book</strong> : Add people to your address book by clicking the star on the message you receive. Use two clicks to add additional information or a photo.</p></li><li><p><strong>Personalized Email Addresses</strong> : If you want a personalized email address, you can sign up for one in Thunderbird. The email service sets it up automatically.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tabbed Email</strong> : Thunderbird took a cue from its sister-app<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/firefox-security-tips-and-tools-2487972" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and added Tabbed email. When you open emails in tabs, you can quickly jump between them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Web Search Inside Thunderbird</strong> : You don’t have to leave Thunderbird to search the web. Type your search term in Thunderbird’s search field and select from several search providers. If you run across an unfamiliar term or concept in an email, right-click it and select<strong>Search the Web</strong> <strong>for</strong> to initiate a search.</p></li><li><p><strong>Search Tools</strong> : Thunderbird indexes your emails and chats so that you can search them quickly. The results appear in a separate tab for reference.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quick Filter Toolbar</strong> : Type words in the Quick Filter search box for nearly instant results. You can also filter by New Messages, Tags, or people in your Address Book.</p></li><li><p><strong>Activity Manager</strong> : Thunderbird’s Activity Manager is the place to look for a synopsis of the interactions between your Thunderbird browser and your email provider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quick Message Archive</strong> : If you don’t need an email message but don’t want to throw it away, send it to the archive folder system by pressing the<strong>A</strong> button.</p></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135357/19272" target="_top" id="2135357">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135357" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135357/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Customize-Your-Thunderbird-Experience"><a href="#Customize-Your-Thunderbird-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Customize Your Thunderbird Experience"></a>Customize Your Thunderbird Experience</h2><p> Thunderbird allows you to customize your email experience in several ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Personas and Themes</strong> : Think of<a class="link"   href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-Us/thunderbird/search/?q=personas&cat=collections?q=personas&cat=collections" >personas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as lightweight skins that change the look and feel of Thunderbird. Hundreds of personas are available for download. You can also download Themes that change all the icons in Thunderbird.</li><li><strong>Smart Folders</strong> : If you have multiple email accounts, you’ll appreciate Smart Folders that combine special folders, such as the Inbox, Sent, and Archive folders. Instead of going to multiple Inbox folders, you can make a single stop.</li><li><strong>Add-ons Manager</strong> : You don’t have to leave Thunderbird and go to an add-ons website. From the Add-ons Manager, view descriptions, ratings, and recommendations of available add-ons that add functionality to Thunderbird.</li><li><strong>Filelink Large-File Management</strong> : Set up Filelink to handle the upload of files that are too large to attach to an email.

It also notifies you when you click a link that will take you to a website that is different from the one indicated in the message.</li><li><strong>Privacy and Do Not Track</strong> : To protect your privacy, Thunderbird automatically blocks remote images in emails. Thunderbird also provides a Do Not Track option associated with Search the Web. It can be used in other requests through the use of an add-on.</li><li><strong>Automated Updates</strong> : Thunderbird notifies you when a security update is available.</li><li><strong>Junk Mail Filters</strong> : Each time you mark an email as spam, Thunderbird learns from your action.

Top brands like Kobalt and Craftsman, as well as smaller brands like Worx, have added electric leaf blowers to their outdoor power tool lines, so you can tackle autumn clean-up chores with ease.</p><h3 id="See-also"><a href="#See-also" class="headerlink" title="See also"></a>See also</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-electric-mower/" >The 5 best electric lawn mowers: Top alternatives to gas-powered By using either a rechargeable battery or extension cord, you can ditch the gas can for a greener way to care for your lawn.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Electric leaf blowers use either batteries or extension cords for power, though I recommend battery-powered models since electrical cables are less maneuverable and potentially dangerous in wet weather. Plus, electric leaf blowers don’t require engine maintenance, so no need to worry about fuel mix or engine oil – you’ll have more time to actually get work done. </p><p>To help you decide which option is right for you, I’ve rounded up the best electric leaf blowers available on the market right now. ZDNET experts analyzed their features and price points so you can find the best fit for your budget and needs. Plus, we explain how leaf blowers work to inform your decision-making process.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/yard-outdoors/best-electric-pressure-washer/"><strong>The best electric pressure washers</strong></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QGNPNP9?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d1bfe4b-3513-4e03-9b91-6590c68baad7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Kobalt 40V Max cordless electric leaf blower Best electric leaf blower overall <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Kobalt</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>40-minute run-time</li><li>Lightweight design</li><li>Turbo button and cruise control</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Battery and charger not included</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p><strong>Battery size:</strong> 40V | <strong>Run time:</strong> 40 minutes | <strong>Weight:</strong> 5.5lbs | <strong>Wind speed:</strong> 110mph | <strong>Air volume:</strong> 480cfm | <strong>Charger and battery included:</strong> No </p><p>The Kobalt 40V Max electric leaf blower is the latest version of the model I personally use, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. The entire unit is lightweight and easy to use, featuring a variable speed trigger, trigger lock for continuous use, and turbo button for blasting away wet or stubborn debris. I use my leaf blower to clear grass clippings after I mow the lawn, and this leaf blower does an excellent job of handling heavy, wet debris, even without turbo mode.</p><p>On a full charge, the Kobalt 40V Max runs for 40 minutes, which is about a month’s worth of clearing leaves from your driveway, sidewalk, and patio. Plus, the leaf blower uses the same 40V Max batteries as other Kobalt-branded outdoor equipment, so you don’t have to buy special batteries. </p><p>The Kobalt 40V Max has a top air speed of 110 miles per hour and can move 480 cubic feet of air per minute (cfm). That means you can clear away everything from wet leaves and fresh grass clippings to fallen acorns and small sticks. The result? Your driveway, sidewalks, and outdoor entertaining areas will look brand new. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QGNPNP9?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d1bfe4b-3513-4e03-9b91-6590c68baad7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RNDQCV3?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d1bfe4b-3513-4e03-9b91-6590c68baad7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Ego Power+ variable speed electric leaf blower Best battery electric leaf blower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Ego Power+</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>90-minute run-time</li><li>Battery and charger included</li><li>200mph&#x2F;765cfm</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Slightly Heavy</li><li>15-minute run-time in Turbo Mode</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p><strong>Battery size:</strong> 56V | <strong>Run time:</strong> 90 minutes | <strong>Weight:</strong> 12.25lbs | <strong>Wind speed:</strong> 200mph | <strong>Air volume:</strong> 765cfm | <strong>Charger and battery included:</strong> Yes </p><p>Battery-powered lawn equipment can get a bad reputation for limited run-time, but the Ego Power+ 56V cordless leaf blower features the most impressive battery life on the market. When used on the lowest setting, this leaf blower runs for up to 150 minutes, so you can clear an entire lawn of dried leaves and grass clippings. On high power settings, you’ll still get an average run-time of 90 minutes, which is plenty of time to clear your sidewalks, driveway, and outdoor entertainment areas.</p><p>This Ego Power+ model reaches a wind speed of 200mph and air volume of 765 cubic feet per minute (cfm), so you can handle wet and stubborn debris. The handle and trigger have an ergonomic design for comfortable use. While the tool weighs just over 12 pounds, making it one of the heavier models on the market, it’s still easy to use.

The M18 Fuel 18V cordless leaf blower uses the same M18 battery as other Milwaukee products, so loyalists can easily add this yardwork tool to the rotation. The motor and fan provide up to 120mph air speed and 450cfm air volume, allowing you to quickly clear leaves, grass clippings, and other debris from your walkways and yard.</p><p>The ergonomic handle, variable speed trigger, and trigger lock make the leaf blower comfortable and easy to use. Plus, the entire unit weighs just 5 pounds, so you won’t get exhausted when clearing stubborn debris from a larger yard. The brushless motor has been upgraded from previous versions, reaching full throttle in under a second. You can spend less time fighting with your leaf blower and more time getting work done. </p><p>It also comes with a battery so you can get started immediately, or maintain it as a backup for other Milwaukee M18 system tools. On a full charge using low to medium settings, you’ll get about 20 minutes of run-time out of this leaf blower – you’ll clear away fallen leaves in no time.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079LC6RHW?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1d1bfe4b-3513-4e03-9b91-6590c68baad7%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.ryobitools.com/products/details/46396036926" >Ryobi 40V Whisper electric leaf blower Best heavy-duty electric leaf blower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Ryobi</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Extremely quiet</li><li>Excellent air speed and volume</li><li>Turbo mode button</li><li>Two batteries and charger included</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Heavy</li><li>Limited run-time</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p><strong>Battery size:</strong> 40V | <strong>Run time:</strong> 20 minutes | <strong>Weight:</strong> 10lbs | <strong>Wind speed:</strong> 190mph | <strong>Air volume:</strong> 730cfm | <strong>Charger and battery included:</strong> Yes</p><p>The Ryobi 40V Whisper cordless electric leaf blower is an excellent option if you have endless leaves to blow or live in a wet climate that makes debris more difficult to clear. It reaches a top air speed of 190 mph and air volume of 730cfm, allowing you to blast away wet and stuck-on debris from your driveway, walkways, and outdoor entertaining areas. If you need even more power, the turbo mode button boosts air speed and volume. However, you will get significantly less turbo run-time than the 20 minutes Ryobi advertises. </p><p>The Ryobi 40V Whisper also features an ergonomic handle, variable speed trigger, and trigger lock, which makes operating the 10-pound leaf blower easy and comfortable. This model comes with two batteries and a charger, so you can get to work right away, keeping the backup battery handy if you need to blow leaves for an extended period of time. It also uses the same 40V batteries as other Ryobi Whisper products, so you can integrate the leaf blower into your tool rotation if you’re a Ryobi brand loyalist. The brushless motor has been updated for the Whisper Series as well, making the leaf blower 7x quieter than previous Ryobi models.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.ryobitools.com/products/details/46396036926" >View now at Ryobi Tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/c/159047/456723/8154?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-40V-HP-Brushless-Whisper-Series-190-MPH-730-CFM-Cordless-Battery-Jet-Fan-Leaf-Blower-with-2-4-0-Ah-Batteries-Charger-RY404100VNM/314600140&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at The Home Depot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>more buying choices </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1492813">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1492813.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1492813">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1492813.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1492813%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1492813/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-best-electric-leaf-blower"><a href="#What-is-the-best-electric-leaf-blower" class="headerlink" title="What is the best electric leaf blower?"></a>What is the best electric leaf blower?</h2><p>My pick for the best electric leaf blower is the Kobalt 40V Max cordless model. It’s an updated version of the model I personally use for lawn care and yard chores. The ergonomic handle and cruise control switch make continuous use easy and comfortable. And the turbo button gives you extra power for clearing wet and stuck-on debris.

If you only need to clear your walkways occasionally or have a small yard, a less powerful model will suit your needs.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Choose this electric leaf blower</strong> <strong>…</strong></th><th><strong>If you need…</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Kobalt 40V Max 480cfm</td><td>A well-rounded electric leaf blower for general yardwork</td></tr><tr><td>Ego Power+ 765cfm</td><td>A powerful electric leaf blower with a long run-time</td></tr><tr><td>Craftsman 20V Max 200cfm</td><td>A budget friendly, battery-powered leaf blower</td></tr><tr><td>Milwaukee M18 Fuel 450cfm</td><td>A high-end electric leaf blower</td></tr><tr><td>Ryobi 40V Whisper 730cfm</td><td>A powerful electric leaf blower for endless leaves</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885947/19272" target="_top" id="1885947">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885947" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885947/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-electric-leaf-blowers"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-electric-leaf-blowers" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these electric leaf blowers?"></a>How did we choose these electric leaf blowers?</h2><p>When analyzing options, I chose battery-powered electric leaf blowers for their power and ease of use. Battery-powered leaf blowers are safer to use than models that require an extension cord, especially if you have a large yard where unwieldy electrical cables could get damaged. I also chose both budget-friendly and high-end models that suit different climates and types of debris.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135418/19272" target="_top" id="2135418">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135418" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135418/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-an-electric-leaf-blower-worth-it"><a href="#Is-an-electric-leaf-blower-worth-it" class="headerlink" title="Is an electric leaf blower worth it?"></a>Is an electric leaf blower worth it?</h2><p>They absolutely can be! Not only does an electric leaf blower eliminate harmful exhaust emissions, but it also means you don’t have to worry about engine maintenance or mixing oil and fuel. Electric leaf blowers are also comparable to gas models in terms of power, offering you the same capability for clearing debris from your walkways, driveway, and outdoor spaces, without the hassle of a gas engine.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115937/19272" target="_top" id="2115937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-more-important-in-a-leaf-blower-Cubic-feet-per-minute-or-miles-per-hour"><a href="#What-is-more-important-in-a-leaf-blower-Cubic-feet-per-minute-or-miles-per-hour" class="headerlink" title="What is more important in a leaf blower: Cubic feet per minute or miles per hour?"></a>What is more important in a leaf blower: Cubic feet per minute or miles per hour?</h2><p>Both factors are equally important. Decent wind speed and air volume are both needed to clear debris quickly and efficiently. A leaf blower that offers high air speed but low volume will handle dry leaves and grass clippings well enough, but won’t be able to clear wet or stuck-on debris. And a leaf blower that has a high air volume but low speed won’t have enough power to clear away anything.</p><h2 id="Are-electric-leaf-blowers-more-powerful-than-gas"><a href="#Are-electric-leaf-blowers-more-powerful-than-gas" class="headerlink" title="Are electric leaf blowers more powerful than gas?"></a>Are electric leaf blowers more powerful than gas?</h2><p>Unfortunately, no. But electric leaf blowers have come a long way since they first hit the market, with most brands offering models just as powerful as gas models. </p><p>Also, battery-powered electric leaf blowers have more power than models that require extension cords, since they have brushless motors for efficient power consumption and operation. </p><h2 id="Are-there-alternative-electric-leaf-blowers-worth-considering"><a href="#Are-there-alternative-electric-leaf-blowers-worth-considering" class="headerlink" title="Are there alternative electric leaf blowers worth considering?"></a>Are there alternative electric leaf blowers worth considering?</h2><p>If you’re in the market for an electric leaf blower, there are tons of models to choose from.

Launched in February of this year, it caught the eyes of artists, designers, and S-Pen lovers, because – frankly, it’s a big tablet. With a 14.6-inch, 120Hz, Super AMOLED panel, the Tab S8 Ultra is arguably the largest tablet on the market (not counting 2-in-1s).</p><p>Besides providing an immersive entertainment experience, the 14.6-inch panel makes for an unbounded canvas, or at least it feels like it. Samsung’s S Pen, which comes included with the tablet, now carries a 2.8ms latency. That means your inputs and strokes appear on the screen the moment the stylus touches it.
